Primarly, the stickyness comes from the bobber, instead of the just holding objects.\\nLeft click to fire your sticky bobber (and anything stuck to it).\\nLeft click again to pull the sticky bobber (and anything stuck to it to you).\\nRight click to disable the sticky for a second (to drop the current object on it).\\nIf you lose track of your bobber, switching weapon and back to it, destroys the old and makes a new one.\\n\\nProp pushing is still against the rules, as thus, attacking players with props from this method is still punishable, if not more so, since its easier to kill players this way. This being said, if two players grab onto the same prop and dont affect any other players, while pushing and pulling between each other, I suppose it wouldnt be against the rules, similarly to how crowbar fights aren\'t."},{"postId":34537,"topicId":4358,"posterId":243,"postTime":1317298277,"postText":"Does this mean that we have to sell our cloakers..?"},{"postId":34538,"topicId":4358,"posterId":605,"postTime":1317299687,"postText":"Yes, yes it does... you have to choose between becoming invisible, or carrying 5+ dead bodies at once... basically."}]}')}}]);
