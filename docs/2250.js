I really do tend to just reply, i try to avoid being the one who starts the whole argument. I have once in awhile but overall i try to avoid it. I wouldn\'t use butt hurt as the term, more of upset then anything. Overall I think the community will get better if more people start helping with the ban requests again. Overall it seems people look negatively on ban requests, and since 90% of them are made under my name i can see why people think i go overboard on em.\\n\\nI try to think more of the overall picture for the community which is why i do a lot of ban requests regardless of what people think of me. I try not to let that bother me so much. I wouldn\'t say i act over the community, but maybe a little more mature then the community. (Trolling for reasons that kinda go beyond me)\\n\\nI believe TTT will be more fun again if we get a few more maps and remove the extremely shitty one. (Minecraft, Catacombs, South Park, exc.)\\nAmsterville is a fun map and a lot of people play it, i think more players will come if we have more maps.\\n\\nIf ya need a list of maps and i can get a guarantee on them going up ill form a list of some good maps other servers have or some updated versions of current maps. Lemme know if ya need a map list. Will prolly start a thread on maps that should/could be added."},{"postId":26428,"topicId":3326,"posterId":243,"postTime":1311742649,"postText":" http://www.straferight.com/photopost/data/500/medium/double-facepalm.jpg "},{"postId":26525,"topicId":3326,"posterId":48,"postTime":1311803561,"postText":">> -image- \\n\\nCmon guys, the point of this thread is to bring the community together again... even if you don\'t agree with someone\\nthere\'s no need to double facepalm a serious post.

Get more admins that have different play times. If we can guarantee a mod/admin on almost all the time it would help a great deal. People who deserve a slay would get slayed. The ban requests are mainly for 30-60 minutes if its something small. I just request something be done since warnings don\'t effect anyone. Warning, stop trolling. (waits 20 minutes or till person leaves to continue)\\n\\nOr another solution would be if some mods/admins could go a lil outa there way to maybe be on server if no one else is on. Quack last night was on even though you could tell he didn\'t exactly want to be. If we have more mods/admins like that it will help a bit."},{"postId":26934,"topicId":3326,"posterId":612,"postTime":1312010540,"postText":"I PLAY ALL THE TIME js"}]}')}}]);
