Keeping the population of Jailbreak happy and content means improving on certain aspects of the gameplay, including basically everything from the weapons and maps of the server, to the administration and upkeep of the server. \\n\\nHere, I want feedback on what you think needs fixing in the Jailbreak server. I will keep an updated list of things to do here, and as things get done, I will state them here.\\n\\nCurrent to do list:\\n- Switch Jailbreak from ULX to Sourcebans \\n- Accept new Jailbreak Applicants\\n\\n\\nThanks for your time!\\nQuack"},{"postId":37063,"topicId":4773,"posterId":1016,"postTime":1320374045,"postText":"Fixing the shop for us Mac users would be nice, worked before and TTT\'s shop works as well."},{"postId":37091,"topicId":4773,"posterId":634,"postTime":1320432256,"postText":"Low Gravity turns off when you get on a ladder.
