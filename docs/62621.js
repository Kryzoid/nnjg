That way you wouldn\'t need to aim for the head with the traitor sniper. Imagine The betrayal, but for long range. We could have it scope in so much that using it long range is the only option. As well having it burst would insure that no one could lag there way out of a shot that would have killed them."},{"postId":26101,"topicId":3286,"posterId":115,"postTime":1311396479,"postText":"We don\'t need new weapons.

The more shitty new weapons we add the more we move away from the original version of TTT. \\nThe current upgrades are too OP as it is.

Now I\'m not sure why you\'d only aim for the head, but it takes usually takes 8 shots to kill in body shots. With one upgrade, it takes 7 shots. With 2, it also takes 7 shots. With 3, 4, then 5 it  also takes 6, so there really is no reason to upgrade past 3 unless you care that much about headshots. Is it OP that you spent 1000 points to have your Mac10 kill in 2 less shots, you decide.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a side note, does the M16 upgrades actually do anything noticeable? Because right now even the standard mac10 beats the shit out of it in all ranges.\\n\\nMy opinion on all guns:\\n-HUGE is the only primary that is exactly how it should be.\\n-Mac10 needs either a nerf or more recoil so it isnt so good at long range.\\n-M16 needs a buff or less recoil so it IS better at long range.\\n-TMP needs a SLIGHT buff, it\'s pretty much impossible to kill someone with it if they have full health, not to mention if they have body armor and then 136 health.\\n-P90 needs its ammo buffed to 50 but damage lowered, since right now theres no reason to pick up a P90 or a TMP over a MAC10.\\n-Pistol is pretty good.\\n-Deagles   NEEDS   a nerf. It\'s better than pretty much any gun, and it\'s a secondary.\\n-Glock could use a bit more damage.\\n-M3 Pump IMO could use a damage buff, but I\'ve only used it like once so I really can\'t say much about it."},{"postId":26186,"topicId":3286,"posterId":115,"postTime":1311539058,"postText":">> The un-upgraded Mac10 does 14 damage for a body shot, and 28 for a headshot.
