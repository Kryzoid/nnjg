Obviously because of the massive downtime you are going to lose most of the original playerbase but give it time and people will find the server on their own and if they like it they\'ll come back. I think that if your goal is to build a community on the server, you\'re focus should be making sure that the server is up and running, that is the #1 priority."},{"postId":35066,"topicId":4434,"posterId":115,"postTime":1318051808,"postText":"Jail is a popular gamemode and is most of the time self-sustaining.

The only thing we need to do is keep moderators on and keep the server up, and they will come back. \\n\\nI can try getting people I had friend-ed back onto the server. Thing is we, or rather you guys, (wait am I part of this community) need to reestablish what the server was and is. Confidence in the server is down due to just how long the server kept crashing and the eventual downtime that followed. Sure some people fled to PoF and others just went to TTT server. We need the mods to come back so far I\'ve only seen 1 and that was Vasto for a chunk of time since the server came back up.
