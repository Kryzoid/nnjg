For example when the motd was working when people would break the rules i would just slap them to death and tell them to look at rule # x and then they would realize there mistakes. But now when they break the rules and get punished they just start a fight saying they did nothing wrong. Then next you know we need an admin to clarify the rules for us but there not always on so thats why the motd should be fixed ASAP.\\n\\nAlso when do you expect sourcebans to be added to the server and will it change our vip commands?"}]}')}}]);
