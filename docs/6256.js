I pointed out rule #3 and said that he HAS to do something about it since its in the rules. I was specifically told by Gash that mods/admins have to enforce the rules in the motd and that\'s what i plan on doing. Glitching or breaking a elevator is not allowed. When i joined you caused the elevator to be stuck at the top and a few people stuck under the elevator at the bottom. The next round i saw you attempting to bug it again and killed you instantly then requested that Funny do something about it. The one day ban was lenient and all i asked for but imo should be much longer since glitching/exploiting elevators and other game mechanics used to be much harsher.\\n\\nThe day been is all i asked for so i don\'t want it extended and was also a warning not to repeat such actions. If you wanna talk about threatening though, maybe next time you shouldn\'t threaten your brother into not enforcing the rules because it\'s gonna cause him much more grief if he doesn\'t enforce a rule he signed up/accepted to do,"}]}')}}]);
