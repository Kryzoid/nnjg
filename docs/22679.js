They said they cannot continue hosting me.\\nI will be switching Jail to a new host(TBD soon.)\\n In addition, VIP will now cost $5 a month to keep up with the much higher server costs.\\nIf you have already purchased VIP you will still have it.\\n I\'m also posting the final tickets from me AND them so you can see why we need to do this switch.\\nMe to them:\\n>> I\'ve tried submitting tickets, emails, and messaging you guys through steam but still nothing has been done. My servers have been down for TWO WEEKS and I\'ve gotten no response and no follow-up from you guys.\\nI like you guys and have always stuck with you but i\'m not paying until my servers are up and if they aren\'t up soon I\'m afraid I\'ll have to switch hosts.\\n \\nThem to me:\\n>> We cannot host your game servers anymore due to the high risk of DDoS attacks. You were attacked soon after we lifted the null route on your IP address. I would suggest that you switch to a less risky game type or get a dedicated server from a provider that offers DDoS mitigation of up to 2Gbps. \\n \\nMe to them:\\n>> Fair enough.\\nI would like to say that I am GREATLY disappointed Brandon.\\nTo kick off my services NOW, with NO WARNING, is disappointing.\\nMy files are gone, and I hope I have backups.\\nI\'ve been a dedicated, loyal customer for a long time, and if you treat your good customers like this, I\'m glad I\'m switching to a better host.\\nI felt like this was coming.\\nIf you had given me a warning, maybe I would still use you for side-projects in the future, but move my primary servers.\\nUnfortunately, you were unprofessional and, while you wrote a nice reply, it was VERY un-timely.\\n\\nRegards,\\nBen\\n "}]}')}}]);
