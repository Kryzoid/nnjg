What happened that day was just me and a friend talking, it was nothing else. I was having troubles with the \\"/home\\" command. And when I typed it and was teleported home, It had worked, but very strangely, there was a rendering glitch around me, and i could see through the walls and look at the blocks around me, however they were randomizing themselves, i was just below dirt the surface at the time, so what was most likely supposed to be stone, had been a completely random assortment of ever-changing blocks that had been precious metals and gems not found at my current depth. This made me curious as to why this was happening, so I consulted my friend once again and told him that it was like i had an X-Ray and something was obscuring its whole hacking thing. I then went on to say that it was probably a mod that either Pirate or someone else had added. And put it off until it happened again, later that day. When it happened this time I told Tin immediately and asked if he could teleport to me and see if he had a similar problem. He didn\'t, and I forget exactly what he did to try and fix me, but i used the \\"/spawn\\" command, and then tried \\"/home\\" again, and the problem was fixed temporarily. Tin went on with his day, as did I, after i collected what i needed from my home, I reset my /home to a place much further away and continued construction on a new home. I did not find out about this whole log check until I got on today, and at the time I was confused and angered because I thought someone had blamed me for recent thefts, and then a friend had told me the true reason and who had blamed me for it, I knew right away what the problem was and how it was caused. All-in-all I was having teleporting problems and got a map glitch that caused me to relate the problem the situation to X-Rays and Hacks. I think that someone misinterpreted the logs and thought that I had foolishly stated out loud that I attempting to use an X-Ray and that it wasn\'t working. I know fully that it\'s impossible for an admin to see in my eyes what I saw, so your going to have to trust me on this one, and know that I never actually Admitted to hacking, I stated that it was like I was hacking and that it was being distorted. I know that this is a very long ban request, but its hard for me to explain in a sentence what happened and have anyone be able to understand it.\\n\\nMore Info: There weren\'t any admins on at the time, It was Yesterday, and I was told by Radio to remove all steam info, if I have to go more in depth with my explanations, I\'ll try for as long as I have to."},{"postId":34640,"topicId":4373,"posterId":456,"postTime":1317490136,"postText":"Quoted from PM.\\n>> \\nAllow me to rephrase.\\n\\n [3:27:10 AM] 2011-09-29 10:50:59 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: oh you sneaky pirate\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:07 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: you made all the blocks through others random\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:07 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: xD\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:14 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: its impossible to hax\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:17 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: no i mean\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:19 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: wait what/\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:20 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: the real pirate\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:23 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: the admin\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:27 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: What are you talking about htough\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:29 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: but popl\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:32 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: if you try to hack\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:34 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: could I see your plantation? :o\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:34 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: it breaks\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:39 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: what breaks\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:40 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: no.\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:40 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: ?\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:43 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: you cant hack\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:44 [INFO] [User] Bluddynucklez\\u001b[37m: whay not\\u001b[0m\\n2011-09-29 10:51:47 [INFO] [User] popl43\\u001b[37m: its impossible\\u001b[0m \\n\\nWhat I want to know is why you said \\"oh you sneaky pirate\\"\\nEssentially you got angry that I installed a new anti-cheat. "},{"postId":34644,"topicId":4373,"posterId":249,"postTime":1317491748,"postText":"Allow me to clear this up, again, I happened to have such a glitch where I could see through the world, and move at the same time. I think i know how your anti cheat works, its probably based on the lighting of certain blocks OR as I stated in my message, blocks through other blocks are randomized, if blocks are completely dark then they\'ll appear as something that they aren\'t, same for the through example. This is exactly why I said there\'s no way your going to believe me, because its not every damn day a /home destination you place recreates some sort X-ray. And what makes you think I was angry? I knew the second this happened that you installed an anti cheat, its common to have one such as this, I\'ve never had or even been able to install any type of hack, simply because I don\'t completely understand it, and I just can\'t be bothered with it. What does make me angry, is that even talking in a way that makes you even seem as if you have hacks will get you a swift and close to impossible to appeal ban. And before you ask why it\'s impossible, it\'s because of the fact I can\'t provide anything besides a worded explanation of what happened on Thursday."},{"postId":34672,"topicId":4373,"posterId":456,"postTime":1317529269,"postText":"We have decided to lower your ban period to 1 day, after talking it over.
