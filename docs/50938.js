Obviously this is not true as I would not be stupid enough to break a rule on a server I paid for VIP on to help stop trollolol\'s and minges.\\nI always tell people why I killed them and I have indeed occasionally killed an innocent when things get hectic without realizing, this mainly occurs when a rebellious individual runs into a crowd.\\n\\nIf i have been banned (I cannot check due to server being down) then may I please be posted this report/evidence behind it?\\n\\nYou have my word that I do not Freekill.\\nMany thanks and hoping this is a rumor.\\nJames."},{"postId":25411,"topicId":3199,"posterId":101,"postTime":1310071973,"postText":"http://onlinecomphelp.com/bans/bans.php/\\n\\n\\nCtrl+F, find your name there.

This foolish person who I forgot the name of started screaming he got the free-kill on video, and then after explaining to him that it wasn\'t he carried on screaming xD\\n\\nI do not free-kill and any accidental kills I apologize a huge amount for and normal give them some points for the inconvenience. \\n\\nI will repeat what I said earlier, and that is that I would not be stupid enough, well nobody would be stupid enough, to break a rule on a server they put money into!\\n\\nWell I look forward to seeing any evidence of a free-kill and it is most likely a 100% chance it was an accidental kill (in which happen very rarely), if that at all :L\\n\\nWhat I want to know is was I ever banned, e.g. will it show up on some record??\\nOr did the admin at the time tell this \\"mao\\" person I was banned, but I never was.\\n\\nThanks for the replies and sorry for any inconvenience these posts may have caused you ^^\'\'\\n\\nHoping the server is back up soon!\\nRegards.\\nJames."},{"postId":25511,"topicId":3199,"posterId":372,"postTime":1310235250,"postText":"There is no list of Jail bans, so the only way to find out if your are banned is to try to log in to the server."},{"postId":25512,"topicId":3199,"posterId":84,"postTime":1310237929,"postText":">> There is no list of Jail bans, so the only way to find out if your are banned is to try to log in to the server. \\nWhich sadly isn\'t possible :("},{"postId":25525,"topicId":3199,"posterId":634,"postTime":1310268477,"postText":">> >> There is no list of Jail bans, so the only way to find out if your are banned is to try to log in to the server. \\nWhich sadly isn\'t possible :( \\nSo this whole thread has been pretty much pointless?"},{"postId":25536,"topicId":3199,"posterId":801,"postTime":1310279654,"postText":"Yes, i guess."},{"postId":25620,"topicId":3199,"posterId":153,"postTime":1310488761,"postText":"Locked."}]}')}}]);
