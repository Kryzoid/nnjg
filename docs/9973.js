Not just little kids.\\nIt makes everyone else have a bad time, when if they were simply gagged, the problem is solved.\\nI know that mods could gag them if they wanted to, but it should be made an official rule.\\n\\nTL;DR: People with annoying microphone usage shouldn\'t use mics, as an official rule."},{"postId":18746,"topicId":2337,"posterId":112,"postTime":1302480052,"postText":"No.\\nI hate this rule.

If you don\'t like it then don\'t play.\\n\\nIf a little kid was spamming or yelling, then by all means he would be gagged. But if he\'s just trying to fucking talk then why should he be treated any differently? And who\'s to decide who deserves to be muted? Theres no black and white line.
