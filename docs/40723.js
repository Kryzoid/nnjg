There\'s only one version of that map. We haven\'t added weapons to the armory yet.

Even very experienced wardens can find it next to impossible to control that map when the deagle spawns.  I would not even put the map on back when the deagle spawned because of how disorderly it was on that map every round.  If the deagle is added once again, it will greatly hurt what could be a great map."},{"postId":25008,"topicId":3136,"posterId":801,"postTime":1309327966,"postText":"yeah its true.. well they should at least, leave like a compact in there, or just a regular handgun, like mars, where its not a deagle, but still is a handgun."},{"postId":25010,"topicId":3136,"posterId":372,"postTime":1309328573,"postText":"There should not be guns in any areas that are very easily accessible every round. Prisoners need to work for their gun, and it also keeps the game balanced. I can see a hidden compact, but one that you get in the cells, every round, it\'s just too easy."},{"postId":25011,"topicId":3136,"posterId":801,"postTime":1309330063,"postText":"what about mars, drop down, and jump in vent area, easy as pie. the struggle is to go in armory, a compact is hard to use, if you have a bad shot, and its a weak gun."},{"postId":25015,"topicId":3136,"posterId":373,"postTime":1309331405,"postText":"The win count for Prisoners is 34 and the Guards is around 5-12 and that\'s with a GOOD warden\\n\\nPrisoners can handle their shit without an OP Nighthawk spawning in their cell."},{"postId":25025,"topicId":3136,"posterId":801,"postTime":1309344256,"postText":"i know, i said at least have a compact pistol, you cant really do much with it, but still would be great to have an option."},{"postId":25029,"topicId":3136,"posterId":372,"postTime":1309354993,"postText":"If you can\'t do much with it, why have it? You still get random Glock spawns. You seem to only be looking at this situation from the Prisoners point of view.  Yes, for prisoners it is awesome to win every single round, but that is not any fun for the Guards, and defeats the idea that Guards start out with an advantage and Prisoners have to be good enough to sway the advantage to their favor."},{"postId":25041,"topicId":3136,"posterId":801,"postTime":1309381471,"postText":"then why not just take out the compact on mars? its not like it gives them that \\"huge\\" advantage as you make it seem."},{"postId":25079,"topicId":3136,"posterId":372,"postTime":1309481127,"postText":"The compact no longer exists on mars."},{"postId":30074,"topicId":3136,"posterId":916,"postTime":1313879714,"postText":"Is Escape Back on the map list yet?"},{"postId":30078,"topicId":3136,"posterId":849,"postTime":1313879946,"postText":"Yeah, Escape came back for like a couple days or so but the vents weren\'t covered so it was really easy for prisoners to rebell, so I think they took it off.
