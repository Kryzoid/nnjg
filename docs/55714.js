Upon the round starting, I went about typical business, not having really played this gamemode before. I shot someone because they hit me, then killed another one when they attacked me. I assumed this would be a natural reaction to someone attacking you. I was then slapped with approximately 900 damage by  -Vasto Lordes-  and died. I was left to spectate for the rest of the round. Lordes cited the slap was due to it being \\"Boxing Day\\". The round restarted, and then he slapped me again with 1000 damage. I then asked for an explanation, and he said that it was for killing him. Lordes only further proved that he\'s abusive with his power, and just because someone killed him, he slays them.\\n\\nJust wanted to report this incident, handle it however you please."},{"postId":28631,"topicId":3566,"posterId":801,"postTime":1313093219,"postText":"first of all, vasto isnt staff.\\nsecond of all, he isnt admin.\\nThird of all, i would like to see screenshots of this event. \\nfourth of all, you must post this in ban request."},{"postId":28640,"topicId":3566,"posterId":812,"postTime":1313094276,"postText":"Yeah dude without screenshots for all we know you\'re talking out of your ass.\\n\\nI don\'t think Vasto is staff, but then again I don\'t know how JB works because I remember Destar being able to slay Freekillers and I don\'t think he\'s staff either.\\n\\nAlso, move to Staff Abuse Reports!
