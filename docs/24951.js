It doesn\'t make sense for a guy who never plays jail to have mod/admin on it while the regulars are complaining about no admins ever being on. Then we refuse to rank anybody else because we \\"already have too many\\". In reality, about all of 4 admins/mods even play jail.\\nBeing Joster, Bird, Quack and maybe Etrius.\\nI don\'t see any point of ranking them on servers they never intend on playing on. It does no good to the players, the server, or anybody. The only thing it does is creates an excuse to refuse to add any of the regulars. People who actually know and abide by the rules.\\n\\nDon\'t get me wrong, I\'m not against the idea of global admins. I just think it would be better if the admin went onto the server (mostly jail) and played like a normal person, then after awhile applied (with full format and recs) to be a mod on that server.\\n\\nOn to the instant admin: This is basically applying to applications. I really don\'t have much to say on this but isn\'t the point of mod to be tested to see if you can handle admin? What\'s the point if you can just apply straight for admin without being a mod first?\\n\\nOn a completely unrelated sidenote: Somebody give Flame forum admin. He needs to be able to take care of his own stuff."},{"postId":22292,"topicId":2772,"posterId":48,"postTime":1305839236,"postText":"Definitely no instant admins, imo it should be: mod test for a week -> mod -> admin.\\n\\nAnd yeah, that makes sense for global mods.
