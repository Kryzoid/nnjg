I will attempt to write down most of the strategies that I use while playing TTT and that can sometimes be extremely helpful. If anyone has strategies that they like to use that they think should be added to the list please post it here.\\n\\n General Tips (Includes Innocent Tips) \\n\\n Deductive Reasoning \\nIf you can establish the innocence of all the players except for the amount of traitors left alive then you may kill any of them on sight.\\nSome things you need to do to make sure you have this right.\\n - Make sure you have the correct Traitor and Player count. There is a 1:4 ratio for traitor to player.\\n   -- To see the amount of of players, go into console and type ttt_print_playercount. This will print the amount of players of the game and you can divide this by 4 to find the amount of traitors. Always round down.\\n   -- As of now there is no way to keep track of the number of traitors that have been killed except for the tab menu. So if any of them leave the game after they have died, you need to keep track of that mentally.\\n http://www.anagrammer.com/common/images/search/d/e/d/u/c/e/-/05.thumbnail.just-deduce-it.jpg \\n Example \\n You find there are 9 players using ttt_print_playercount\\nBy dividing by 4 you get that there are 2 Traitors\\n1 Traitor and 4 innocents are already dead. Leaving 3 innocents and 1 traitor left.\\nYou know that you are innocent, you are not proven.\\nUsing some form of proving innocence you prove that players X and Y are innocent.\\nPlayer Z must be the traitor, you may kill him, since you are not proven no one else may kill him unless you die.\\n[/list:o:2nh1jxjd]\\n\\n Upgrades \\nThe NNJG Shop (F4) Has a wide variety of upgrades that can help you in combat, movement, and survivability.\\nYou can earn points for kills on the opposing team and play time.\\nYou can save up these points to buy upgrades.\\n http://hartalmsm.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/do-you-feel-lucky-punk.png?w=440&h=240&crop=1 \\n Mystery Boxes  give you a random chance to get ANY item in the shop that you do not already own.\\n\\n Call-outs \\nIf you hear someone call someone else out as a traitor take their word on it and help them or let them kill each other, \\nafterwords if they were wrong either;\\nA: Give them time to explain why they called them out or killed them and then judge whether you should kill them. or\\nB: Kill them immediately for a false call-out or for killing an innocent.\\neither one works and both are completely fine within the rules.\\n\\n Last Words / Suit Zoom \\nIf someone has their name is in last words try and decipher whether it was being used in conversation or to call someone out. If unable to find out assume the latter.\\nThere are say-commands listed in the suit zoom menu that can be used for quick call-outs that will often stick in last words.\\nThese quick commands will insert the name of your target into simple phrases.\\nthe two most important say commands are \\"I\'m with \'target\'\'.\\" and \\"\'target\'\' is a traitor!\\"\\nyou can bind a key to \\"I\'m with \'target\'\'.\\" by typing \\"bind \\"key\\" \\"ttt_radio imwith\\"\\" (ignore two outermost quotation marks.)\\nyou can bind a key to \\"\'target\'\' is a traitor!\\" by typing \\"bind \\"key\\" \\"ttt_radio traitor\\"\\" (ignore two outermost quotation marks.)\\n\\n Defusing Jihads \\nWhen someone Jihads it should set your brain to hardcore, red alert, shit-going-down mode.\\nLook around and find the guy with sparks shooting from him. There is your target.\\nEveryone needs to help, often times a Jihad will barely be successful because a portion of the people decided not to shoot.\\nRunning from Jihads is a good tactic too but if you successfully defuse the Jihad you will be doing a greater service to your team.\\n\\n\\n Trust No One \\nUnless someone is proven innocent they could quite possibly be out to kill you, watch your back.\\n\\n Search Traitors/Detectives \\nWhen one dies look around to see if they dropped any special equipment.\\nOften times traitors will leave the DNA scanner by the detectives body after they kill them.\\n\\n Misfires \\nIf someone \\"misfires\\" near you or hits you. blow their face off and tell them to be more careful next time.\\n\\n Strafing \\nI\'m sure most of you know this already but at all times make sure you strafe. Move around back and forth make it hard for someone to get a head shot on you.\\nYou can\'t Strafe as easily when typing so having a mic makes you much more likely to survive in TTT.\\nIt is also important to strafe in gunfights.\\n http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Circlestrafing_animation.gif \\n\\n Beware of Groups of 5+ \\nJihads will often be your demise if you hang out with 6 people in a cramped hallway.\\n Stay in Groups of 3-4 \\nGetting knifed will often be your demise if you hang out alone or with non-proven individuals.\\nOften being with a group of 3 can be dangerous because of the change of 2 of them being Traitors.\\n\\n \\"Proven\\" Innocents \\nOften times people will consider someone who has killed a traitor as \\"proven\\" to be innocent, as only a teamkilling traitor would kill another traitor.\\nUnless, if you\'re a traitor and someone starts calling out a fellow traitor buddy with decent evidence, stay away from your buddy. If you end up in the same room as your traitor friend with an innocent or detective, and you\'re not willing to drop disguise yet, you\'re going to have to at least start shooting in the direction of your buddy, As not doing so looks highly suspicious, and could even give someone enough reason to shoot YOU. Afterwards you can claim to be \\"proven\\" along with whoever else in the room.\\nThat works both ways. So if you\'re innocent and someone is a \\"proven\\" innocent. Well, at least doubt them a little.\\n courtesy of FootChar \\n\\n The Kryzoid \\nWhen traitor, wait for one of your traitor buddies to die and then exclaim in mic/text chat that you found a rocket jump on their corpse. Then buy one from your traitor shop and have fun.\\n courtesy of Kryzoid    Duh.  \\n\\n Detective Tips \\n\\n DNA Scanning \\nDNA is the most common and easiest way for traitors to be found.\\nAlways call detectives to bodies with DNA.\\nAlways have a spare credit as a detective to purchase a DNA scanner if the need arises.\\nThe flare gun for Traitors is an excellent choice of a purchase in the C shop because of this.\\n http://207.239.98.44/genetics_clip_image001.gif \\n\\n Don\'t be followed \\nPeople who follow you are scary and want to eat your brains.\\n\\n Reward the Innocents \\nIf you have extra credits and there are innocents that are proven innocent, give them a present.\\nEmpowering your allies with an mp5 or a health station will make the game much harder for traitors.\\n\\n http://wikicheats.gametrailers.com/images/thumb/1/17/Bioshock_Power_People.jpg/180px-Bioshock_Power_People.jpg \\n\\n Keep your friends somewhat close and your enemies very far away. \\nThose that are proven innocent should remain near you so that you have mutual protection.\\nDon\'t get too close though, especially if its a group of 4 or more.\\n\\n Be careful with health stations \\nOnly give them to proven innocents. \\nWarn people multiple times before you put it down that \\"if you are not proven innocent and you use this health station, I will kill you.\\"\\nMake sure your health station does not go unguarded. Either destroy it or leave a guard to defend it after you are done with it.\\n\\n Last seen and visualizer \\nYou may not kill anyone alone for last seen unless you can confirm they were looking at the killer when they died using the visualizer. This can make the visualizer much more useful than the DNA scanner in some cases, so you may call the person out so anyone can kill them instead of just some innocents following you. However, if they were not looking at the person when they died, the visualizer is rendered useless and the last seen may only make a person more suspicious.\\n courtesy of Dum \\n\\n Traitor Tips \\n\\n Take Advantage of Traitor Weapons \\nThose weapons are there for a reason, you are outnumbered.\\nYou need to take advantage of each weapon\'s unique abilities to the situation that suits them best.\\nThere are some extremely versatile weapons that can be used in many situations but there are also more specific scenario weapons.\\n http://www.fpsgod.com/wordpress/media/knife.jpg \\n Knives are your best friend as a traitor. \\n\\n Be careful with Jihads \\nThey are only useful if you get 4+ innocent kills with them or if they are necessary to finish of the last few players remaining.\\nDon\'t use them in a room with lots of cover/exits that people can easily use.\\nDon\'t stand still; A single person can kill a jihad-er if they stand still. Jump around \\n http://cdn3.pjtv.com/content-images/Jihad-yes-we-can.jpg \\n\\n Traps \\nThere are traitor traps on many maps, use them to thin out the herd and make your goal easier.\\n http://th1108.photobucket.com/albums/h411/Ohtoha/th_my_trap_card.jpg \\n\\n Kill Detectives \\nWith the detectives gone you don\'t have to worry about DNA screwing you over.\\nIf you don\'t kill detectives and leave bodies around recklessly, the detective will most likely get DNA on you.\\nWhen you kill a detective be sure to search for any special equipment he dropped.\\n\\n Luring \\nYou can call detectives to bodies. When people search bodies they are often venerable.\\nYou can use the time when people search bodies to get an easy knife or head-shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\'s all I\'ve typed for now check back for new hints from me and the other TTT players of NNJG."},{"postId":26011,"topicId":3282,"posterId":769,"postTime":1311363662,"postText":"Hey I just wanted to say I love you"},{"postId":26012,"topicId":3282,"posterId":272,"postTime":1311363801,"postText":"Reminded me of this.\\n http://survivallink.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Zombie%E2%80%99s-survival-guide.jpg "},{"postId":26013,"topicId":3282,"posterId":969,"postTime":1311364733,"postText":"Nice Topic idea, and a lot of effort in the OP, thanks for that.\\n\\nAnyways just to add to the discussion.\\n\\n \\"Proven\\" Innocents \\nOften times people will consider someone who has killed a traitor as \\"proven\\" to be innocent, as only a teamkilling traitor would kill another traitor.\\nUnless, if you\'re a traitor and someone starts calling out a fellow traitor buddy with decent evidence, stay away from your buddy.
