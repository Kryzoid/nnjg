I enjoy it very much because it is a very friendly server and also has low traffic which enables it\'s users to become friends. This server is one of the only good flood servers I have found, and I would hate to never be able to come back and enjoy the game. I made friends with Rainrain, while playing so I am sure he can vouch for me that I am a good kid. I know for a fact that AFKing is not against rules and it doesn\'t hurt anyone. However, if need be, I will stop AFKing for I do see how it can be unfair and unsportsmanlike to do so. I believe that the ban was far too harsh for such a minimal crime, all it would have taken was a kick from the server so I couldnt AFK on it then, when I were to log back in, have a Admin tell me that I was no to continue to do so. This would have solved the problem for I am a reasonable person. I thank you for taking the time and effort to read my post and I hope to play with you back on the flood server."},{"postId":1705,"topicId":172,"posterId":2,"postTime":1275153432,"postText":">> \\nYour In-Game name: Weezer209\\nYour Steam ID:Weezr2\\nReason: I truly have no idea why, possibly because I was AFKing.\\nLength of Ban: Permanent, at least I think so.\\nWho banned you?: No clue.\\nWhy should we unban you?: I have enjoyed playing on this server for the past few days.
