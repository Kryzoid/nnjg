I know there are people who don\'t like me and people who don\'t think I\'m not a good player or a nice person, I just get really upset when people break the rules and when no one does (or is there to do) anything about it. But I\'ve been playing TTT for awhile I\'ve always upheld the rules never been banned or slayed(maybe once or twice cant be 100% sure) or muted or kicked. I\'ve always done my best as a person to respect other players even when I\'m being disrespected constantly. There are Defiantly better choices out there than me (cough* Funnyraff* Cough) but, I would still like to be considered.\\n\\nThank you for reading my Application."},{"postId":17785,"topicId":2198,"posterId":54,"postTime":1300944404,"postText":"in my experience with you, I say no.
