The inhabitants seemed to have magically disappeared overnight. I was immediately drawn into the world, for a completely free game, the visuals are astonishing, as a matter of fact, by any standards it is astonishing. The world emanates a lonely, forgotten feel that contributes greatly to the overall theme and tone of the game. Trees sway in the howling wind, grass rises tall and is rendered with great detail, water refracts realistically and most of all, the fog that encases you is foreboding, and frightful. Where the game lacks graphical flair is in the natural stone formations on islands and most of the land masses, which are blocky and have poor texturing. However, the game does make up for it in both the vegetation and indoor areas, which range from warm, welcoming summer home-like cabins, softly lit by candles that still burn bright, to dark, industrial-like underground  places. It establishes a fantastic visual style that retains a very unique atmosphere, fantastic aesthetics and graphics.\\n\\n http://i.imgur.com/HUmT8.jpg \\n The fog and against the backdrop of water is often astonishing \\n\\nThe music is very melancholic, it tells a story of it\'s own that suits the game well, riding your ship, with nothing  between you but a wall of fog and the water ahead is incredible, it is also something you will be doing for the majority of the short time it takes to play this game. The two main things that you do in this game are, discover islands and explore those islands, it doesn\'t seem like much but the story is something that should not be missed by anyone, truly is amazing. Exploring the islands are a treat all it\'s own, the environment and music resonates an unforgettable story that is told flawlessly, both through the notes you collect and the places you go to. It is a story driven game, and the amazing thing is that the story can be played  part-way through or in different orders, and it will still feel complete and coherent, and has many different meanings and interpretations. I unknowingly captained my boat off the edge of the world, the fog immediately engulfed my ship, and I thought it was part of the game until I hit sand outside the map\'s boundaries, however I felt I knew what I needed to know, felt as if my story was complete and I had suffered a similar fate to that of the people that once inhabited the islands.  I don\'t want to spoil any of the most important locations, which are also the most amazing, one place in particular is probably the saddest in video game history.\\n\\n http://i.imgur.com/2tZL7.jpg \\n Environments communicate the game\'s story, it is clear everything was handled with great attention to detail. (Also, this isn\'t the saddest place in video game history) \\n\\nSjorok is something that belongs in an art museum, it is the perfect example of what modern adventure games might have been like if they were still as popular as they once where. The music is melancholic, the environments are breath-taking and the story is unforgettable. If you can excuse a few technical issues, you should be downloading this game and donating right away."},{"postId":36309,"topicId":4645,"posterId":373,"postTime":1319515062,"postText":"How do I turn down the settings and how do I make it english?"}]}')}}]);
