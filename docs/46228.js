However, I can say that i\'ve been playing NNJG for about two months.\\n\\n8) What you can bring to the [NNJG] Team (Web/Graphic Design, Lua/other Coder, Moderation, Map Maker, ect.)?: Moderation in TTT\\n\\n9) Why do you want to be part of the [NNJG]Team?:\\nSo many times I am playing on the server with a bunch of other regulars, and I see someone rdming or trolling and all I can do is message someone else and ask them to come and help. I play TTT all day, every day(except when there\'s extreme lag like the past day :c), and if I were moderator I could be there when people need me to take care of a problem.\\n\\n10 ) Any GMOD/TF2/CSS experience:\\nNope.\\n\\n11) Have you ever owned a GMOD/TF2/CSS server?:\\nNope.\\n\\n12) Do you have a microphone?
