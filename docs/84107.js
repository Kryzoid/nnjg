This game is a great combination of RTS and FPS and has a great mix of strategy, skill, and progression.\\nNS2 pits 2 teams against one another, 1 team consists of aliens with mostly melee abilities and zerg like appearances (starcraft reference). The other team is a team of marines similar to the colonial marines from the alien series. Both teams are led by a commander that can build supply, research, and defense structures and supply their soldiers with ammo and health. One team wins when all the other teams command stations are destroyed.\\n\\n http://www.naturalselection2.com/ \\n\\n\\n http://www.wolfire.com/ns2og/screenies/ns23.jpg \\n http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/games/1/10/9998/thumb_620x2000/NS2_skulk_vent.jpg \\n\\n\\nIt\'s still in beta right now but it\'s a fun game and I highly recommend it."},{"postId":28946,"topicId":3597,"posterId":876,"postTime":1313204990,"postText":"NO. lulululu"},{"postId":28954,"topicId":3597,"posterId":82,"postTime":1313211875,"postText":"Thank you"}]}')}}]);
