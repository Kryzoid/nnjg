They have auto modes like any other camera but in manual modes require some learning so you can really take advantage of all the features. Also, they and their interchangeable lenses can be very expensive. Lenses can be anywhere from $100 -$10,000 depending on quality, focal length, size, etc. and camera bodies can be as much as $7000. Many DSLRs come with a kit lens that will cover most of your needs, so unless it is a serious hobby or profession for you, expensive lenses will be unneeded.\\n\\nHere  is a good entry level DSLR that has new features like HD video recording. Not sure how much you want to spend on a camera, but this one is $900. It\'s a lot of money to spend so make sure you will be able to use all the features a camera like this has to offer, try reading online guides or something."}]}')}}]);
