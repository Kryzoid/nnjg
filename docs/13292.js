Don\'t lie to me.

It said \\"]runscript change sv_cheats 1]thirdperson]firstperson\\", a direct copy from his console, and then I scanned him on the server and it showed he in-fact  did  change sv_cheats for himself, and the dll he was using wasn\'t added to the blacklist for VAC. At least yet, anyway. He mere fact that he pasted the console information in chat, shows us that it wasn\'t an automatic bind, but technically a confession showing he can use a small script to change sv_cheats.)"}]}')}}]);
