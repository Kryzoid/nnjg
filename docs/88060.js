Of course my friend Sadie wanted it (she\'s all insecure about her sounding bad). So, when Spring Break is over, I\'m going to get the un-auto tuned version and get it sent to me and make a video :). Well, I don\'t make the videos, my friend Chris makes them really. (the ones with on-screen lyrics, Kry made the first one I put up)."},{"postId":17185,"topicId":2078,"posterId":292,"postTime":1299997444,"postText":"Great lyrics, but i agree with others, auto tune doesn\'t fit the song much. Non-auto tune version would be better ^^\\n\\nGreat song :D"}]}')}}]);
