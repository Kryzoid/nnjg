How is saying one word a perma ban i find that is a little extreme and there was an admin on who did not slay the rdmer so how come i recived a punishment when the rdmer did not? I find this very unfair and request an unban because I dont see anything major about what I did. I belived the admin should have slayed me for saying this word \\"AssHole\\" but I always hear people using similar words and they dont recive bans. I realy like the sever but, I dont think saying\\" Asshole\\" should be a perma ban. Can any admins please respond to this unban request as fast as possabile.\\n\\nEdit: I know the rdmer was Flame and I think he was the admin who perma banned me.\\nEdit: I am Fluffy Puffy."},{"postId":22229,"topicId":2763,"posterId":397,"postTime":1305767982,"postText":"Your In-Game name:\\nYour Steam ID:\\nReason:\\nLength of Ban/Date and Time of Unban:\\nWhat server were you playing?:\\nWho banned you?:\\nWhy should we unban you?:\\n\\nuse correct template"},{"postId":22230,"topicId":2763,"posterId":316,"postTime":1305768029,"postText":"Sir, this is quite humoress to me, please just stop or ill die of laughter"},{"postId":22231,"topicId":2763,"posterId":389,"postTime":1305768118,"postText":"What Smooglez said and LOL AT U!\\n\\n1.
