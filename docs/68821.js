I\'m just going to compile all the incidents that are not exactly covered in the rules, and hopefully receive answers. I was going to originally post this in the Unlisted Rules Thread  but I kind of thought this could turn into a thread where people will ask these sort of \'\'what if\'\' questions and receive answers from the community, and I\'ll possibly edit them into the OP. \\n\\nBut for now here are mine, and I\'ve listed them in order of importance, imo. When answering a question please give the number of the question you are answering. And if you need me to re-word or give an example of I will gladly do so.\\n\\nALSO while this will be open to the community, I would appreciate it if admins+ will give their opinion so each specific thing could be sort of set in stone.\\n\\n#1:Is calling out the Detective a traitorous act that you can be killed for?\\n>> 1.no. not really, its obvious its a joke \\n\\n#2:Can Detectives Traitorbait, and what I mean by that is I know they can\'t be Traitors, but if they randomly shoot and such is that against the rules for them?\\n>> 2. as long as you arent actually shooting and hurting them \\n\\n#3:When someone is clearly in another players last words, is the first person that says KOS X after the last words considered to be proven innocent or not?\\n>>  3. not until the person dies and is proven a traitor \\n\\n#4:If someone is blocking you in a position that the only way out is if they move when they can clearly move, if you warn them three times do you have the right to kill that person?\\n>>  4. just right click your crowbar, also if you can ue your hands to jump over them do so \\n\\n\\n#5:If a detective is clearly RDM\'ing, can you kill the detective as an innocent and it will not be considered against the rules, or do you have to just allow him to go on his reign of terror?\\n>> If its mass RDM like killing every fucking person he sees \\n\\n\\n#6:Can you kill someone who pushed you with a crowbar and you felt that if you hadn\'t moved out of the way you would have died from that push?\\n>> yes \\n\\n\\n#7:If someone has last words describing that the Traitor is wearing a distinguishable item from the shop, say a green trail and a pot head, and you see that person later on, do you kill them or must you just suspect them, even when you\'re CERTAIN that they are the only person with that combination or independent equipped item?\\n>>  7. ehhhhhhh maybe depends if its VERY certain. if its a unique trail go for it \\n\\n\\n#8:Do you have to ask your Traitor Buddies if you can advance disguise as them?\\n>> 8. why would you want to anyways \\n\\n#9:If you warn someone to stop following you once, then they clearly start following you again but it\'s totally seperate from the last warning can you continue with a second warning, or will it count as a first warning again?\\n>> 9. and yes, first warning again if there a break in between \\n\\n\\n\\nI will also add each answer to their respective question in a spoiler under each when they are answered. Anyways, thank you."},{"postId":32412,"topicId":4021,"posterId":79,"postTime":1315348650,"postText":"1) False call out is always traitorous\\n\\n2) They traitor baiting is same as inno traitor baiting.\\n\\n3) If its in last words your not proven.\\n\\n4) If they don\'t get out of your way while blocking, you can kill after warnings.\\n\\n5) If the detective shoots you randomly, return fire even if your inno. His rdm will be punished more then yours.\\n\\n6) Pushing when close to edge is traitorous.\\n\\n7) Who knows if only one person has the item, you cant kill based on items alone. (Only ones you can are special trails like Destars or Udanes(no one else can get those))\\n\\n8) If you disguise as a traitor buddy and get them killed it should be rdm. (imo its blatantly getting a ally killed for trolling/stupidity(this one needs Gash\'s clarification))\\n\\n9) Personally i give them 3 TOTAL warnings per round. If they continually do it round after round i report them to admin and tell them if they continue i will no longer be giving 3 warnings a round. (Trolling is worse then rdm, ill gladly get slayed or day banned for a troll to be perma\'d)\\n\\nAll of these are based off current knowledge that i have and some thoughts about what should happen. None of these are 100% accurate"},{"postId":32419,"topicId":4021,"posterId":812,"postTime":1315350582,"postText":"Alright thank you Crisis I\'ll edit all that in. Keep in mind anyone call still respond even though Crisis had also done so."},{"postId":32432,"topicId":4021,"posterId":237,"postTime":1315353035,"postText":"And now for the other end of the spectrum from crisis...\\n\\n1) False call out on a detective is obviously just screwing around (SUPER TATOR!), and mistakes happen where you think it\'s someone and it isn\'t. A per case deal.\\n\\n2) It\'s not traitor baiting if they\'re definitely not a traitor.\\n\\n3) I really don\'t think so. Too easy for a quick traitor to do it, especially if it\'s wrong.\\n\\n4) You should definitely warn at least twice, or push them yourself. If they are still blocking it\'s time for some lead to fly.\\n\\n5) It\'s the detective. Under no circumstances should you kill him. Allow the massacre, post the ban request.\\n\\n6) Totally. Kill him/her.\\n\\n7) I agree with udane\'s and stuff, it depends though. If you\'re sure, like...really sure.\\n\\n8) If you disguise as a traitor buddy you\'re a derp.\\n\\n9) I know i consider it a new time, so 3 more warnings, although the second time around i would give them much quicker."},{"postId":32448,"topicId":4021,"posterId":812,"postTime":1315359560,"postText":"Alright, change of plans, I\'m only going to edit the OP with official statements, pretty much an admin or so.

If you are a detective and drop some of your detective equipment to say buy a health station, and someone picks up that equipment, can you kill them after warning them three times?\\n\\n#11. When someone killed a traitor, and said traitor dropped a Traitor weapon, if a person who was not involved killing that Traitor picked up that weapon can you kill them being they are not proven innocent.\\n\\n\\nAlso, on a sidenote, I really need a strong confirmation on the first scenario because I really just see a 50/50 response from the community."},{"postId":32812,"topicId":4021,"posterId":101,"postTime":1315629910,"postText":"10. Yes, but I highly recommend saying \\"Don\'t pick this up or I\'ll kill you.\\" beforehand.\\n\\n11. Crisis has tried to pull that on me. No. If you know they got it from a dead traitor, they shouldn\'t be killed for it."},{"postId":32828,"topicId":4021,"posterId":79,"postTime":1315637988,"postText":"On #11, I feel if they are NOT proven. You should be able to kill them for it. It would be like having a detective item when no detectives are dead. Where did you get it and why wasn\'t the detective id\'d?\\n\\nI feel #11 needs to be specified by Gash. Since I am sure that many different admins feel different ways on that topic.
