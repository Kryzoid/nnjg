I\'m ishuu in minecraft. I am offering my and my teams\'\' services to all of you. We are  builders, mega structure builders. We build massive structures and we build quickly. We can make you pretty much anything you want. We like to build and it\'s pretty much my passion being that it\'s virtual legos with the world as my land scape. (the flat green peice that no Lego know to man fits on.). If you are interested in a huge house, mob grinder, cactus farm, rave room, beat maker, hidden doors, locking system with a password, list goes on.  One thing tho. My services aren\'t free (in terms of minecraft bartering, not real money :P (which you know, would be rather cool if you like my work:3)) and would cost a reasonable fee. If you are interested in my work, please catch me in game. Im online all the time! \\n\\nThanks\\n- Cerebral: building division"},{"postId":23514,"topicId":2935,"posterId":456,"postTime":1307477726,"postText":"I\'m pcnm0430 and I approve this message"},{"postId":23517,"topicId":2935,"posterId":612,"postTime":1307478928,"postText":">> I\'m pcnm0430 and I approve this messageâ€‰\\n\\n\\nThank you, if you want i could do some sample work for free in CC\\n\\njust clear me out a 20x20x10high and ill make the CC a rave room\\npleasE!"}]}')}}]);
