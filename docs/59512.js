Today, Gash made a support ticket to Xenon asking about server uptime, but after \\"horrible customer service\\" and a few hours of waiting, there is still no luck.\\n\\nGash says that the current available options are to either wait for Xenon, or to transfer to a new host. The only problem at the moment is that funds are too low, and without donations, we won\'t be able to switch hosts and will have to wait however much time for whatever Xenon has to throw at us.\\n\\nIf you want to help the cause for *NOT ONLY* sooner uptime   BUT   improved server quality as well, we would greatly appreciate it if you made a donation to the TTT server  in this troubled time.\\n\\nOther than this, we do apologize for the downtime.\\nAlso, if you\'re interested in a complete timeline of events, click here. "},{"postId":23043,"topicId":2873,"posterId":488,"postTime":1306817417,"postText":"Ugh, this makes me really wish it was possible for me to donate. -_-\\nIt really sucks that Xenon isn\'t responding.\\nSomeone donate $10 for me, please. :P"},{"postId":23044,"topicId":2873,"posterId":54,"postTime":1306817892,"postText":"i\'ll try and talk to BOOM when he gets on."},{"postId":23055,"topicId":2873,"posterId":364,"postTime":1306861066,"postText":"Wait... gash only need 40 to get the server up again.
