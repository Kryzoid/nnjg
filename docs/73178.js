He had a 3-4 line paragraph typed in which is against the rules cause if i left awhile ago, he wouldn\'t have had time to delete it and it would have looked like he was mid typing when it happened. Ive never complained about a small sentence because 1 line is easy to type if u have average typing speed. (40 word/min) But 4 lines takes at least 15-20 seconds even for fast typers. Also, i requested a slay because he had a 4 line thing and his defense was, \\"Gash does it all the time.\\" People need to stop using that excuse, Gash is the OWNER of the server, in reality he can do things others can not. Does everyone agree with this no, but we can\'t exactly complain about it. I would ask Gash to not do anything on the server that\'s against the rules for others, but it\'s his choice whether or not to do so. Current mood being a factor, personally if I am upset i don\'t play any games, but others release stress playing games."},{"postId":19701,"topicId":2454,"posterId":389,"postTime":1303838265,"postText":"Well imo....

Building has stairs down and a ladder to the roof. It was clear he typed it when i ran around the corner to get rdy to kill him by makin sure no one was coming. I went up and around corner and 1-2 seconds later i shoot to kill him. I left the room for atleast 5-10 seconds. So there was no reason for him to have a paragraph typed out or even to have started typing in first place. Right when i get down stairs without even shooting 2 people open fire on me and then the rest do and kill me. I understand why i was killed, but not why there was a paragraph typed out by him when i wasn\'t in room for 5-10 seconds and entered room for only 2 at the max, maybe 3. Time flies in the game at times. So even if he was to type my name in those 2-3 seconds, it would not have ended up being 3-4 lines even with holding down a key for spamming."},{"postId":19713,"topicId":2454,"posterId":521,"postTime":1303849468,"postText":"Stop lying crisis.

Taking at least 30 seconds. So what he did was clearly a random accusation at the time and even if i didn\'t kill him i would of been rdm\'d a lil later cause of his text. Thank you for confirming what you did was go afk to get a drink after typing out a paragraph."},{"postId":19723,"topicId":2454,"posterId":101,"postTime":1303852878,"postText":"Think of it as insurance."},{"postId":19917,"topicId":2454,"posterId":612,"postTime":1304032828,"postText":">> Think of it as insurance. \\nThis. \\n\\nI think it should be fine to do. I wouldn\'t say if it says some ones name its a KOS for them its the same thing as saying in mic chat \\"if i die I\'m with....\\". But you should be allowed to type \\"I\'m now dead\\" or something. It would teach pol not to kill afks."},{"postId":19960,"topicId":2454,"posterId":634,"postTime":1304040983,"postText":"Seriously? I don\'t know why these things become such a big deal. I often type things in the chatbar before I die and I\'ve never been told it is wrong. If someone brings a problem to the mods they should let the person know they hear their complaint and investigate and let the person who brought up the issue know if they can do something or not. After that the issue is over. Amins/Mods have the final say in what happens and shouldn\'t be swayed by players, only the rules and their interpretation of them."},{"postId":19987,"topicId":2454,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304073494,"postText":"Crisis just likes being a pain in peoples side.
