Maybe make VIP votes more. Like two, or three, or even four votes.\\n\\n Note: My spelling suxz... And I fogot that I wasn\'t using FireFox until the last part was being finished. Since this is a lame-ass Public computer. I am not going to bother waiting another 5 min for FireFox to open up, then another 5ive getting to the site, Plus a final Five waiting for it to copy and past when I am already done. \\n\\nPros - It would be a bit easier to get the Majority votes needed for a vote kick.\\n- When admins/mods vote to change map or making a vote of there own, VIPs would get a bit more say.\\n\\nCons - It would only take 2-3 VIP to pick which map the server will play. That would mean most popular maps would alwasy run. Cyberpunk, Peaches/Peaches realisom, Minecraft/Minecraft update, and then maybe richland/homegrown/clue.\\n\\nOther ideas I\'d like you to consider...\\n\\nMaybe lowering the Majority needed for a votekick. Because most rdmer/hackers come in pairs... if not more. I just had a problem like this last night. Where one person came on with 2 others and he started rdming/trussing with his friends. I\'ll post the whole story in ban request later today... once I get home. \\n\\n On another note... NNJG had a full house up untill like 3-3:30 in the morning... And even then It didn\'t dip under 10 untill 6AM-ish. ^.^ I really think you should consider opening more slots Gash. Just puting it out there. \\n\\nBut long story short... when I tryed to vote kick them. Obviously the three of them would not vote eachother out. Added that players on the server at the time didn\'t really care for the young kids being trolled. Some people would Pick not to vote or vote no. I had to start gaging people because arguments started geting out of hand once the kids left and the rdmers aimed for those who tryed to help them. Which was give or take half the server. \\n\\nIt would be a real help if it didn\'t take so many votes for just a kick. Even giving VIPs extra votes would allow two or three VIPs to call upon each other, to get the majority votes needed when there isn\'t an admin around. I know that Admins can\'t be on 24/7, But vips are players. Players who how like the server, like the clan/group, and want to do there part to make it better. Because they are on 24/7. (not nearly as corny as I hoped, but this statement dose not count the times when the server is empty... because that happens to) I also know that there have been some insidents in the past where VIPs may or may not (but mostly may... or alwasy did) abused there powers. I just wanted to voice some of my ideas."},{"postId":19587,"topicId":2457,"posterId":521,"postTime":1303753826,"postText":"ttt vips dont really abuse\\nits the jail vips like coneh and statix and nolskeys that abuse the hell out of slap and rageslay people"},{"postId":19597,"topicId":2457,"posterId":389,"postTime":1303755875,"postText":"WOW 3am - 6am ish. .... ..... . do u ppl have no school / study for exams....\\n\\nI wanna help ya guys but im not gonna be on for another week prob.

I can understand not wanting to kick an afk out of uncertainty, but not prop killers and the likes.\\n\\n>> When admins/mods vote to change map or making a vote of there own, VIPs would get a bit more say. \\nThis I do not like, mostly for the reason you listed in the \\"Cons\\"... Also if this were to happen, I\'d have to name my maps something very similar to the popular maps, so that when they dont rtv the popular maps, letting it auto change to the next map, it goes to my maps ;p\\n\\n>>  On another note...

Just puting it out there.  \\nMore slots=more crampt spaces/jihads... more so in smaller maps, like clue. Which would lead to more upset people about being jihaded without knowing where it was coming from for sure.\\nThis and... I would have to re-re-reupdate the map I released to increase the number of spawn locations (currently only 25 places you can spawn.)\\n\\nOff Topic:\\n>> WOW 3am - 6am ish. .... ..... . do u ppl have no school / study for exams.... \\nI like how its assumed we all are in school of some sort...
