I would like to appologize to the owners for saying bad things about this clan on the forums. I thought that [NNJG] was over-reacting, but now I see that I was the one over-reacting, also to Ito/Silver Revege/q= for offending you or making you mad in any way, as I quote \\" I know your type\\" I dont know what your trying to say man, as well as any other members I angered. And I lastly I would like to say Im sorry for anything you saw [NNJG]Crausadia. Ive been trying to tell you for so long man, but you blocked my communication. THAT WASNT ME THAT SAID ANY OF THAT TO YOU. My friend found out about the situation and typed it to the first guy in the clan he saw on my friends list and I wasnt even in the room. I would NEVER say that about Ben, EVER. Well lastly anyone angered at me I hope that in your hearts you can find the kindness to forgive me.\\nThank You                                                                              - [NNJG] Zack"},{"postId":7544,"topicId":806,"posterId":153,"postTime":1284335397,"postText":"Thanks for the apology.\\nMeans alot."},{"postId":7554,"topicId":806,"posterId":101,"postTime":1284341167,"postText":"I SAY NO!
