I get on steam and talk to people sure, but even when I\'m online, I\'m usually doing something. I don\'t want to be demoted, because I still love NNJG, I just need to get things in my life right. I\'m gonna spill my guts here to you guise...\\n\\nWhen I was in middle school (6th, 6th, and 7th grade), I was bullied a lot. And yes, I failed 6th grade once. I\'m supposed to be in 9th right now, but nope, I\'m in 8th. ANYWAYS, I was bullied a lot, I didn\'t have many friends, and I never experienced the writing I did. I didn\'t have anything to write when I was there, because there was no one or anything to write about, all I felt was depression. So, I moved schools to SASIC, where I am now, and I\'m really doing better. No one picks on me, I have TONS of friends, and I have a girl that I might be in love with, but I\'m only 14, so I don\'t know really. It feels like it though.. most of my songs are even about her.\\n\\nSo, at this point, I\'m trying to have a life, a life better than what I had, I\'m a compulsive thinker, I think WAY to much on shit, so I can just sit in my room, and think. My thoughts will go into other thoughts of thoughts. I\'ll just space out sometimes and not realize it. So, that\'s another reason why I don\'t get on when I\'m at my computer. I\'ll either be writing, talking to someone on steam, texting, or thinking. I try my best to come on every once in a while, but it\'s hard. I\'m doing much better than I have ever been before. I\'m sorry that I\'m not as active, I can\'t help it though. I don\'t want to get kicked out of my position, that\'s why I\'m writing this.\\n\\nSorry about the essay, I just felt you all should know about me and my life a little, cause I love you guise<3"},{"postId":20405,"topicId":2549,"posterId":595,"postTime":1304301573,"postText":"Sir.
