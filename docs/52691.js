I\'m not against the idea, it just seems like a large hassle for something that will add very little to the game.\\n\\nWhen a traitor leaves their weapons behind, it is a final chance for them to kill someone, whether or not they are directly responsible, and if you are an innocent, you don\'t have to pick up the weapon (99.9% of my rounds I play, I play with the intent on fucking around so I will pick it up, I expect to die). When a traitor leaves a C4, an innocent shouldn\'t pick it up and reuse it, this principle applies to all other traitor weapons.\\n\\nAlso excuse any spelling errors, I am not using Chrome, therefore no spell check D:"},{"postId":30384,"topicId":3730,"posterId":735,"postTime":1313981651,"postText":"+support"},{"postId":30390,"topicId":3730,"posterId":112,"postTime":1313984257,"postText":"-support\\n\\nTraitors are sometimes able to pretend like they picked up one of their weapons they got from a comrade, it would be unfair to remove the ability."},{"postId":35485,"topicId":3730,"posterId":1081,"postTime":1318759127,"postText":">> I\'ve seen it on some servers, where when you kill a traitor and ID the body in the body description it will show what weapons that traitor was carrying at the time of his death.\\n\\nAdding this in would would stop the confusion about the acquiring of traitor weapons and prevent alot of deaths.\\n\\nAlso this is already implemented with say the Radar, and an Adv.Disguiser, please just allow it with the rest of the traitor weapons :D \\nYES this would be greatly appreciated it would help the server greatly so innocents if they think that they bought it and they think they r a traitor they can 1 see the traitors kill in tab and find the body which will be the most useful and recommended if trying to figure out if they \\"bought\\" it as the traitor instead of just geting it from the traitor"},{"postId":35497,"topicId":3730,"posterId":517,"postTime":1318778216,"postText":">> >> I\'ve seen it on some servers, where when you kill a traitor and ID the body in the body description it will show what weapons that traitor was carrying at the time of his death.\\n\\nAdding this in would would stop the confusion about the acquiring of traitor weapons and prevent alot of deaths.\\n\\nAlso this is already implemented with say the Radar, and an Adv.Disguiser, please just allow it with the rest of the traitor weapons :D \\nYES this would be greatly appreciated it would help the server greatly so innocents if they think that they bought it and they think they r a traitor they can 1 see the traitors kill in tab and find the body which will be the most useful and recommended if trying to figure out if they \\"bought\\" it as the traitor instead of just geting it from the traitor \\nBump old topics much, and I\'d support this if only detectives could see it"},{"postId":35570,"topicId":3730,"posterId":812,"postTime":1318819044,"postText":"Yeah, you\'ve revived a pretty old thread good sir.\\n\\nAnyway, I\'m going to lock this, I would no longer like to see this implemented as I\'ve come to the conclusion that weaponplanting is very useful traitor strategy, and I would hate for it to be removed."}]}')}}]);
