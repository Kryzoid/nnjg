Someone presses the button on an innocent, and whoever was closest or looked as if they did it is killed, alot of the time them being innocent as well, and sometimes they\'re not actually the ones who pressed it.\\n\\n\\nI don\'t know if this is impossible to do ourselves unless the actual map has this feature in it, but on other TTT maps in the Events tab it will show which traitor pressed buttons and such so I know it can be done. If it is possible to make it where it can show who pressed the button, please allow this, it will save alot of confusion."},{"postId":29896,"topicId":3686,"posterId":2,"postTime":1313739076,"postText":"It would require the map to be edited."},{"postId":29897,"topicId":3686,"posterId":812,"postTime":1313739282,"postText":"Well shit.\\n\\nWould that be really hard to do Gash?

Problem may or may not be solved, I\'m not a hammer genius. \\nCustom textures, as in, textures the mapper made himself/downloaded offline, that are not included in any other normal game. In other words, you\'d have to ask the mapper to give you the custom textures he made for the map, so you can replace them in... in addition, you\'ll also have to know how to bind the custom textures into the map.\\nThis is also the same problem with the few custom sounds that map includes."}]}')}}]);
