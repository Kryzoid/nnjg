It takes like 20 minutes for the round to end, and it has nothing to do with jailbreak, i cannot explain what it is, if you need someone to do that, before making this decision, ask stratos for a description on what it is. I feel very strongly that this should be banned, because when i join the jailbreak server is expect to play jailbreak not some \\"turf  wars\\", if people dont want to play jailbreak i suggest they find a new server that way those of us who do, dont have to wait for 20 minutes."},{"postId":36286,"topicId":4643,"posterId":372,"postTime":1319503977,"postText":"Never heard of this \\"Turf Wars\\" game, but I will attempt to find out what it is, then evaluate whether it should be banned or not.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention."},{"postId":36313,"topicId":4643,"posterId":1016,"postTime":1319527776,"postText":"Those curious as to what \\"Turf War\\" is, just the map was practically split in half with prisoners only being allowed on one side, and guards on the other -usually with the armory on their side. Practically nothing but baiting on both sides, although as we know guards have guns, thus prisoners were mowed down. Like on default days where some people are scared to do anything, the round literally lasted a good 20+ minutes (whereas default day is maybe 5-10 minutes) with 5 prisoners on a somewhat full server."},{"postId":36370,"topicId":4643,"posterId":1151,"postTime":1319587357,"postText":"Pretty much what he said. Unless Own3r is on (and sometimes even when he\'s on) nobody understands the rules and it really sucks. We briefly talked about changing the rules to make it go faster though. A suggestion that once there are 5 or less prisoners it becomes a boxing day (or it was something like that) was made, and that sounds fairly logical, so with time I can see this becoming a pretty normal thing, but it would require the support of admins, mods, as well as the normal players. Being a normal player, though, I don\'t have much say, so I guess we\'ll just have to see how this transpires."},{"postId":36424,"topicId":4643,"posterId":1016,"postTime":1319648300,"postText":"No Turf War is no longer around says Mag, aka MarioDJW, after he jumped on the server. Just waiting for the written word from him."},{"postId":36437,"topicId":4643,"posterId":1140,"postTime":1319660557,"postText":"I agree with these being banned. Seems that daily, more and more people have been requesting turf wars, but they always end up taking FOREVER."},{"postId":36515,"topicId":4643,"posterId":481,"postTime":1319741975,"postText":"I don\'t agree with having turf day removed completely, but it will need to have some changes such as.\\n1. The Turf War\'s will only be aloud to last 5 to 10 minutes (Depending on Prisoner Activity) then the guard\'s will be aloud to change it to a different game.\\n2.The game must always have a Mod, Admin, Etc that is willing to advice the game and enforce the rules is on.\\n3. It can only be played if a player who knows all the rules of this game (Such as own3r) is on to explain the rules in detail before the game begins."},{"postId":36594,"topicId":4643,"posterId":372,"postTime":1319771006,"postText":"As of now, Turf wars are banned because they involve excessive delaying of a round and encourage guard baiting, which is not allowed.\\n\\nThe game has no point, offers no enjoyment to prisoners or guard, and there is no real way to enforce all of the rules that Etruis has suggested."},{"postId":36607,"topicId":4643,"posterId":1140,"postTime":1319777349,"postText":"Thanks.
