As i was attacked, i killed prisoners and the others around, then mark said i would be banned, everyone around me said i was ok nad right, then he banned me for 5000 minutes. I demand i be unbanned, because i am innocent!\\n To which many replied such as\\n\\n\\nHello, I am Rubixx.\\n\\nI am a witness of what happened and all I can say is that Mimeslayer is 100% innocent. He did not deserve a ban, it was Mark who lacked common sense in the situation at the time. \\n\\n\\"Mark banned [NNJG] Mimeslayer1337 for 5000 minute(s) (You cannot free kill, but you did, therefore, YOU GOT PUNISHEDDDDD)\\nP\\" \\n\\nHe did not freekill, he was the last guard and was being gang-banged by all the prisoners. So, he had EVERY right to kill them.\\n\\nSome of the prisoners only said \\"Freekill!\\" because they are just really mad because they got majorly owned and probably cried when they did get owned.\\n\\nMime deserves to be unbanned and Mark should get his powers revoked.
