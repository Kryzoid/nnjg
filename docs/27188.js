The traitor (don\'t know his name) stands alone himself, with another 3 innocent, for specific it\'s Udane, Luamvera , and ryancarson52 (Yes, I have a good memory). The traitor keeps the round going for like 3 - 4 minutes. Every spectator in the server doesn\'t know how to contact him when he\'s alive, so I use the function, which is @message to contact him to slay the traitor, but he didn\'t do it. After that round, I got ban for 1 week because of ghosting."},{"postId":34449,"topicId":4342,"posterId":605,"postTime":1317164765,"postText":"I asked you once after that round in text if you were ghosting (because you told me directly who was the Traitor, instead of asking me to tell the T to hurry up), and didnt reply. You also informed me through the @ chat to kill anyone who touched your health station, which by itself is attempting to cause rdm.\\nAlso, you asked after 2 minutes of him not moving to slay him, of which I said in admin chat for the Ts to move, and he moved 20 or so seconds later. Better then slaying as he actually got a kill and stopped not doing anything.\\nNow that you spoke up, I believe you didnt intend to ghost, and just wanted the round over. I dunno if you missed me asking why you specifically told me who the T was, or looked away during, or just plain ignored it, but im probably at fault for not asking a few times over like usual.\\nUnbanned due to the belief you probably were not intending anything ill. Next time, please inform me to tell the Ts to hurry up instead of who the Ts are directly unless I request the name for the slay."}]}')}}]);
