It kills me to say it, but it\'s the truth.\\n\\nI was referred to your gaming clan\'s servers by a great number of the members of a forum I frequently post in (last time I checked I had around 2000 posts there). I trust many of the members and decided to try your servers out.\\n\\nLong story short, I loved them.\\n\\nIt seemed at first that you had a great community with excellent admins. I have been playing your servers for about a month or two now and I must say I love them. Today I decided to join your TTT server because I couldn\'t think of anything to do on Minecraft and I was at a standstill with my RPG project. I played a few rounds without major events happening, except for one instance of Pharaoh killing me because I was shooting a sniper rifle. I was shooting said sniper rifle into the spike room windows of the traitor room in ttt_lost_temple in an attempt to kill any would be assailants whom decided to push the button. I did this because I had died in the exact same room just a couple of rounds ago. Anyways, I still had a great time. After one round I was asked to take my dog out by my father, which I did. I came back and waited until the new round started. When I spawned I found that I was stuck within a player, [Xero] Kush to be precise. We tried pushing each other out of one another to no avail. When the game started he happened to be a detective, unfortunately there was no other way for me to remove Kush from myself, so I killed him. I killed him in the fear that he would kill me first and I would have to wait another round before I was able to play again. I then played the round normally, or at least tried to, as everyone was trying to kill me for killing Kush. After finding out I had naught but 8 health, I committed suicide. I was greeted to the afterlife by hearing Kush rant on about how I killed him. I said I was sorry and I told him that I thought there was no other way. Lo and behold Pharaoh died and told me he was going to slay me. This made absolutely no sense to me, considering that the only reason I killed Kush was that with both of us alive we were both quite immobile and would\'ve succumbed to death by the hands of a Traitor anyways. Pharaoh would not listen to my pleas. After the next round started he made good on his threat. From this angle it seemed an extremely shortsighted decision and I wanted to let Pharaoh know this is what I thought. Although at the time I was the only dead person, if I would have typed or voice chatted anything it would\'ve been the equivalent of talking to a brick wall. I then decided to change my name and leave the server to a message that would let Pharaoh know of my opinion about him. Being steamed up at his decision I of course put some profanity into the message and rejoined. As I joined Pharaoh was obviously very angry about my comment and decided to ban me in a fit of rage.\\n\\nLong story short, Pharaoh made bad decisions, I decided to speak my mind about them in the best way that I could and got banned for it.\\n\\nA three day ban would usually be nothing to me, as I have a great variety of activities to occupy myself with in the meantime. It is the mere principle of the situation that drove me to ask for an appeal.\\n\\nPlease acknowledge my side of the story and respond accordingly.\\n\\nI had also thought of joining your community and wearing the [NNJG] moniker, but now I am not so sure."},{"postId":6811,"topicId":758,"posterId":4,"postTime":1283639203,"postText":"Unfortunately, these things happen a lot in TTT.\\n WHEN YOU GET STUCK WITH SOMEONE, DO NOT FIGHT EACH OTHER.
