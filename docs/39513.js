It\'ll get boring really quickly. We need more slots for PERP, and there isn\'t even a legit copy of PERP. Hosting it means we\'re hosting a leak, and I do not support that. If you  want  to go buy PERP, the overpriced gamemode that shouldn\'t even be legal to sell, go ahead and let us host it. That also means we have to increase slots, in which means that Ben either has to get regular donations in order to keep the server running.\\n\\nIn terms of server costs:\\nFlood < PERP\\n\\nIt\'s cheaper to host Flood, and we just need to get it populated. And if we  do  get a PERP, what makes us different then the generic PERP servers out there? We need advanced coders to make us stuff if we even  do  host it, not just my lazy self that isn\'t even half as good as someone you can hire. Do you want to host PERP? Make Ben agree to it, and get us constant donations. Ben needs the funds to host a larger server, right now it\'s fine because it\'s only 10 slots, but if you want it around 40 slots (Which is good for PERP.) then come up with a way for us to make extra money. Oh, and by \\"extra money\\" that includes buying the gamemode. I don\'t want us to host a leak.\\n\\n Edit2 :\\nMy god I couldn\'t even read the first sentence that I posted on my first edit.
