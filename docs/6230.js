I was going to suggest have a separate forum for each server, but then that would make things to cluttered in my opinion and this way method makes up for that.\\n\\n2.I don\'t know if it\'s possible, but if all unlocked threads can be pushed to the top, and locked threads be pushed to the bottom, so unanswered requests will hopefully never be missed.\\n\\n3.Also don\'t know if this is possible in phpbb, but when making a new thread, the ban request format is already provided so threads MUST have the template. This could also be directed at the unban requests forum too.\\n\\n(Minor) 4.
