The computer is probably running for upwards of 20 hours a day and the computers can\'t take it. She has literally burnt out 2 laptops from apparent overuse. She now wants to go with a netbook because its smaller, but im affraid she\'s going to need to buy a new one every few months. I guess i need to know if this issue is going to actually happen, whether theres a certain direction to go in to make it less likely (i.e. netbook vs ipad vs small laptop?)\\n\\nhalp"},{"postId":5644,"topicId":604,"posterId":4,"postTime":1282067627,"postText":"get one with a very good cooling system"},{"postId":5704,"topicId":604,"posterId":2,"postTime":1282168171,"postText":"A desktop computer lasts longer."},{"postId":5712,"topicId":604,"posterId":4,"postTime":1282175878,"postText":">> A desktop computer lasts longer.â€‰\\nand they are easier to upgrade as well :D"}]}')}}]);
