(ban requests and what not)\\n\\nOverall, there has just been a spiral downhill since rule breaking seems to be getting allowed more and more. As of now all the mods+ don\'t even know the basis of the rules and slay when more then 1 player complains. As of such, since one player asks friends to complain with them on someone they don\'t like, it causes mods+ to also dislike that person since it seems like they break the rules a lot and as such no longer have a say when stuff happens to them. Some of the issues might be repeats for the most part but i felt this was needed to be posted as a general issue.\\n\\nIf others see more issues please post them so maybe mods+ can be demoted from not doing there job or maybe will start doing there job again."},{"postId":23748,"topicId":2984,"posterId":605,"postTime":1307770410,"postText":"I do reason 2 when I see reason 1 or 5. I hate mods or admins not doing their job. (Though in some cases, I understand where they are too busy or the likes, but if they are told they need to check something for possible rdm, theres lil to no excuse)\\nI too dislike people who do reason 4 and 7.\\nI believe reason 6 comes about being worn down for certain people (in other words, too much stress for them). Taking care of a TTT server is harder then most other types of servers.\\nAs for 9, I think you\'d gotta more into detail of leniently. Ie. If I know someone who frequents the server often enough, sometimes i\'ll drop the slay for a !slap <name> 99, letting them have a chance to play the round, but still recieveing a heafty punishment for their wrong doing.\\nAnd 10, I hate as well.\\n\\nCrisis, you insinuate no one understands the rules as if you are the only one who does, but it\'s not you who makes them. Please refrain from such comments, as those who do work hard are being lumped in with those who you believe dont.\\nPeople who whine dont get what they want as far as I\'m concerned, I go by damagelog and questioning what the possible offenders have done.\\n\\nI\'d do have one other complaint to add to the list, bringing in constant quarrels you have with others into the game. A long drawn out argument usualy only irritates people. This is my sole issue with some others though, be it actually something that is problematic or not isn\'t my place to decide.\\n\\nOne point I will agree with you on, there are some specific \\"mods+\\" I wish would work harder or pay attention more."},{"postId":23749,"topicId":2984,"posterId":79,"postTime":1307771202,"postText":"As a whole, more then half the mods and admins do at least 4-5 of the things i listed.
