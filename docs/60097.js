I was already playing on the server for serveral maps being banned for \\"aimbot\\". And no one said anything earlier. My guess is it was because of a lucky round i had on whatever map I was banned on. I\'m pretty sure most of the server was watching me at the time too and those that were on will probably I wasn\'t aimbotting.

And how about the other 3 kills? Were they all one deags? As far as I know they werent. I could understand if I got all 1 deags and killed them all with less than a clip that would be considered aimbot but I didnt. It took multiple clips to kill them all. And \\"...it looked alot like an aimbot.\\" What did my \\"aimbot\\" look like? Can someone who was there explain to me what \\"it\\" looked like. I also believe I stabbed someone with a knife during that round I was banned. Did I \\"aimbot\\" the stab too?\\n\\n*Edit* Does anyone have a demo? Also I was on the server for plenty of maps prior and no one said anything to me then.
