Twenty years later, you come home from working in a gun factory and watched TV with your wife and two kids when you hear marching outside.  You go to investigate and you find, as far as the eye can see, an army of G.I. Joes, lead by a familiar looking, cracked, pale, gum on his head one that said “why did you shun me away, why? After all we went through? All the times we took out that dreaded Cobra Commander Figure together? I shall have my REVENGE!!!!!!!!!”  Before you on two sticks held by two G.I.’s is the heads of the two bullies, on with a wad of gum on it, and then you hear screams, they’ve got your family.

Joes that once represented Freedom, now represent Terrorism, and they get completely annihilated and you go down in history as an American Hero who stood up for the Ideals of America, You pee yourself, crap your pants, faint, and allow the G.I. Joes eat you and your family, then escape while the whole world laughs at your misfortune and you go down as the biggest pussy in Human History.\\nC.
