You firstly ran up and killed someone for no reason at all. Then you just watched the ceiling and waited for someone to die upstairs, in which it wasn\'t even true. The guy jumped on his own free will, and you decided to go up and kill the guy on the roof. You watched as it went down from below. I saw you watching the ceiling. Then after you saw someone fall, you ran up and killed the guy. It was quite obvious you were RDMing."},{"postId":29583,"topicId":3615,"posterId":1018,"postTime":1313485788,"postText":"Oh, so why didn\'t you just ban me for RDM unless rdm is hacking these days?"},{"postId":29584,"topicId":3615,"posterId":54,"postTime":1313492607,"postText":">> Oh, so why didn\'t you just ban me for RDM unless rdm is hacking these days?  The reason on the ban is \\"troll\\" because you were rdming."},{"postId":29615,"topicId":3615,"posterId":1018,"postTime":1313529678,"postText":"Well it wa a little harsh for a perma ban for rdming 2 people.
