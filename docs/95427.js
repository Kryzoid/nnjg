I\'m ready to drop the bullish if you are. I mean on both sides so for me it would include no more name calling, mingery,rage kicking, trolling,or the works. I would ask that no one reply to this before crisis does. And then only if its something important or relevant. Thanks. Well I\'m over it. I told you what it means for me.
