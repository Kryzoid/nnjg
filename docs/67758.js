If going afk for anything more then 2-3 seconds your only allowed to put \'i died ****\'\'. If you do this and the person you called out is killed, you are convicted of blatant rdm and slayed next round\\". That was overall what was put when i made this remark prolly about a month ago. It doesn\'t seem right to say \\"so and so is traitor\\" and go afk for 30 seconds, because in that 30 seconds. ANYTHING could have happened, including the guy killing you or leaving the area right after you go afk.\\n\\nOverall blatant call-out while afk is random accusing cause there is no proof they killed you while you were afk and as such should be a slay able offense like was said in my post.
