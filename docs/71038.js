No one has stated that you gave it to the Community/Clan ether. However I would like to further discuss the topic at hand.\\n  \\n It\'s pretty clear the dates are real, that\'s just an excuse you\'ve pulled out your ass because you can\'t think of anything better. \\n\\nWell, it may not be (that the dates are real), and I always tell my clients that this is not verifiable proof. A checksum is a better way, and can be used in a court case.\\nThis \\"excuse\\" part, I\'m not excuse anything (or trying to). It\'s all down to the proof.  You don\'t ban unless you see proof, I hope. \\n\\nAs pointed out in this example, it\'s easy to change any date that windows gives for a file (or just photoshop the image).  http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/5527/10055679.png \\n\\nYea, computers existed in the 1600\'s...\\n\\n  \\n \\"plus what the fuck actually is that code\\" & \\"i\'ve never seen an au3 file extension before\\" \\n\\nYet again, I\'m not making this up, or attempting to. Autoit  is a BASIC like language that\'s been around for years. It is currently in version 3. The common code extension (like lua uses \\".lua\\") is \\".au3\\", pointing that it\'s autoit and version 3.\\n\\nYet again, you can see the Autoit code in action:  http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/5527/10055679.png . It\'s really quite easy to understand.\\n\\nAnd if you need help reading the code, (the only function used) the help for the compiler is here:  http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/functions/FileSetTime.htm \\n  \\n\\n \\"Why exactly are you so butthurt? Wah wah, he\'s got some dartgun QQ\\" \\"Carry on bitching and I\'ll just upload a fixed version to gmodorg to make you shut the fuck up and deal with it, boota nor nitro care if I do.\\" \\n\\nI don\'t seem mad I hope. I\'m actually laughing at this whole thing, as you may know from this stupid bs legal format I\'m trying to follow... XD\\n  \\n\\n\\nThank you for understanding Internetz N00b 007.\\n ~ NNJG Legal Team =) "},{"postId":11117,"topicId":1195,"posterId":2,"postTime":1290401752,"postText":"Dark has to show how pr0 1337 he is."},{"postId":11131,"topicId":1195,"posterId":222,"postTime":1290455913,"postText":">> Dark has to show how pr0 1337 he is. \\n\\nYep...\\n\\nOr better yet:\\n\\nY3D\\n__|"},{"postId":11154,"topicId":1195,"posterId":55,"postTime":1290463750,"postText":"Actually Yes I\'m dead I have to say bye for idk how much time"},{"postId":11188,"topicId":1195,"posterId":222,"postTime":1290541569,"postText":">> Actually Yes I\'m dead I have to say bye for idk how much time \\nTo fix it, Mak isn\'t dead anymore.."}]}')}}]);
