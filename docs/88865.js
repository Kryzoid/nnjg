Hopefully this clears up all of your questions and concerns about my activeness.\\n- I check the forums at least 3 times a day. You can constantly check my profile for the \\"last online\\" time and will update periodically throughout the day.\\n- I won\'t post unless I feel it is necessary.\\n- I am in contact with certain staff members almost every day, and get notified/respond if any issues occur.\\n- I don\'t have a computer that can run GMOD at the moment, but I\'m working on it.\\n- I\'m at school from 8:00-5:30 every day, and have homework and work after that.\\n-You can always contact me through the forums or to REDACTED@REDACTED and expect a response in a couple hours(unless you email me at 3:00AM EST.)"}]}')}}]);
