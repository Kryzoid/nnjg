But since he\'s already unbanned and you decided whatever. I know that you wouldn\'t reverse it either. He completely deserved the ban I gave him, and i\'m pretty upset that you didn\'t even consult the ones involved in the situation."},{"postId":17325,"topicId":2081,"posterId":153,"postTime":1300155192,"postText":"I always thought Luigi was a good player.\\nI think another chance is in order."}]}')}}]);
