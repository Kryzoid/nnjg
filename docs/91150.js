I\'ve been playing on the servers daily since Gash invited me to the steam group in April.\\n6) What you can bring to the [NNJG] Team (Web/Graphic Design, Lua/other Coder, Moderation, Map Maker, ect.)Server moderation.\\n7) Why you want to be part of the [NNJG]Team. When there are no admins on the servers everything turns to chaos. I want to be a moderator so that I can stop the minge bags from ruining fun servers.\\n8 ) Any other GMOD experience: Not really.\\n9) Have you ever owned a GMOD server? Nope, but I know the admin commands.\\n10) Any other Comments. I hate RDMers!
