If you don\'t see a guy and he shoots you with 2 bullets, you die. Sure, there are perks for say more bullet damage, but really that\'s the difference between like 2 and 5. With an automatic weapon, big deal.\\n\\nIn MMOs the way you spec, the gear and weapons you have, the skills you decide to use etc. actually really do matter, and imo it takes a lot more skill to be good in an mmo than a fps.\\n\\nand @ quick reaction times, implying you don\'t need those in MMOs?\\n\\nif the opponent is at low health and they try to cast a 1.5 second heal that will heal them for roughly 20 or 30% health, by the time you see they\'re casting, half a second will probably be gone, your spell also takes probably 0.2 seconds to activate, and you have to be close enough to them... one simple mistake and they could be back at half health, and you could lose.\\n\\nsome spells are probably even less than 1 second.\\n\\nand on top of this, abilities have cooldowns, so you have to save them for the perfect time to use them based off when your opponent uses their abilities. in an fps, you just both shoot eachother. real hard."},{"postId":17133,"topicId":2059,"posterId":389,"postTime":1299960331,"postText":"Can you guys stop comparing the two....? \\nThere both 2 different genres, and shouldnt be compared.\\n\\nFrom the current view you guys are comparing MMORPG and FPS, because MMO\'s dont only consist of MMORPGs."},{"postId":17188,"topicId":2059,"posterId":292,"postTime":1299998262,"postText":"Well, games like this and GTA just aren\'t my type of game.
