This is also shown with all improvement discussions on the forums being restricted to the Staff Corner and Board of Directors Section with an extremely limited number of people being able to access them. Bird is moving the clan in the right direction while simultaneously you two are pushing it backwards (not to mention the fact you\'re dumping a lot of the problems on him yet you rank him below yourselves). The Board of Directors was a waste of time; most of its members do nothing, and as far as I\'m concerned any discussions as to what should be done for improvement should be open discussion, not in a restricted forum section. I\'m not saying that what I believe needs to be implemented, but you should really use a system that works best for everyone in the clan and not what is just easiest or best for the two of you. I would not only like to hear back from you two, but from other members of the community as well because most of the discussion of this type is locked away in your restricted sections. \\n\\n-Yours truly,\\n  Dick  "},{"postId":12819,"topicId":1429,"posterId":4,"postTime":1293511776,"postText":">> Bird is moving the clan in the right direction while simultaneously you two are pushing it backwards (not to mention the fact you\'re dumping a lot of the problems on him yet you rank him below yourselves). \\n+support, but i wouldn\'t say they are exactly pushing it backwards, since the particular thread in the staff corner called \\"how to stop admin abusers and unsatisfied players in one swoop\\" started, i don\'t think i have seen one instance other than the one you\'re speaking of in which they are \\"pushing it backwards.\\" And yeah, i don\'t like where the whole \\"Board of Directors\\" status is right now, hopefully that will change in the 2011 election and new year of NNJG."},{"postId":12847,"topicId":1429,"posterId":67,"postTime":1293557255,"postText":"You mean the 2011 election that hasn\'t been planned at all yet.."},{"postId":12866,"topicId":1429,"posterId":101,"postTime":1293573242,"postText":"Yeah, they make all the stuff that the public needs to comment on in the BOD board, so all of us are just looking at it with no choice but to just watch :/"},{"postId":12869,"topicId":1429,"posterId":153,"postTime":1293574196,"postText":">> Yeah, they make all the stuff that the public needs to comment on in the BOD board, so all of us are just looking at it with no choice but to just watch :/ \\nNo,\\nWe will have an election for it, I\'ll figure it out.\\nWhen we do, we\'ll need active members.\\nThe BOD Board is only for BOD Discussion.
