Made easy so that people with shitty comps can play it.\\n\\nIts userbase is active, with about 500 active members. It\'s pretty fun. And if anyone has played cave story before, they have the Quote and Curly in the game as well.\\n\\nBut yeah, I\'ve been playing it for a year and a half now. It doesnt really get old, as the administartors and developers keep it updated.\\n\\nCheck it out, the download for it takes only 3 seconds.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of cool things on their forums.
