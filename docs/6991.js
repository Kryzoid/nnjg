Fit the textures so that the boxes are not all same sized square boxes (you never see perfectly stacked, same sized square boxes in a building, why see it in a map using realistic textures?)\\n\\nI would like to see this map flourish after you\'ve put more time into it :o"},{"postId":31485,"topicId":3879,"posterId":1061,"postTime":1314757471,"postText":"..."},{"postId":31488,"topicId":3879,"posterId":605,"postTime":1314757954,"postText":"I\'m sorry if any of this offended you, i\'m attempting to offer you constructive critisism, so you know how to improve."},{"postId":31498,"topicId":3879,"posterId":1061,"postTime":1314761249,"postText":"oh thast fine then lmao"},{"postId":31533,"topicId":3879,"posterId":153,"postTime":1314790569,"postText":"Wow Udane, good advice :D\\nI too think this map has potential, and if there\'s anyone who knows how to help you, it\'s Udane :D"}]}')}}]);
