After he shot me i returned fire and end up getting shot by LJ because he had to pick someone to shoot. I was traitor and he doesn\'t understand you CANT shoot someone with a shotgun the second after u get hit by a rifle."},{"postId":25920,"topicId":3269,"posterId":237,"postTime":1311186154,"postText":"Bullshit. Crisis is lying. I was right next to crisis when i shot torrence with the rifle. ban happy bastard.\\nTorrence reacted in a very acceptable way and this should not be acted on.\\n\\nAll of it happened like 2 feet away from torrence."},{"postId":25921,"topicId":3269,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311186387,"postText":"How am i supposed to know your behind me, and he shot first. Damage logs show he shot me first, there is no debate on this at all. He shot me for having a shotgun when he got hit by a rifle. If thats not enough proof then no amount of proof would be acceptable to ban anyone when you get rdm\'d as a traitor and revenge rdm will happen every time someone gets rdm\'d as traitor. Cause you CANT revenge rdm unless you are rdm\'d first. Thats what the term revenge means, something happened first and you need to get back.\\n\\nOver all the proof i posted shows he shot me first and i hit no one before that so it was blatantly killing me for getting hit by a rifle. Regardless of where you were the fact is he shot me instead and since he was on fire it HAD to be a rifle and not a awp."},{"postId":25922,"topicId":3269,"posterId":237,"postTime":1311186822,"postText":"i shot him from right behind you. RIGHT BEHIND YOU. he thought that you were the shooter, so he acted in the way he should when attacked.\\n\\n\\"Regardless of where you were the fact is he shot me instead and since he was on fire it HAD to be a rifle and not a awp.\\"\\n\\n1. i recall you had a shotgun\\n2. he\'s fairly new and may not know about incendiary ammo\\n3. he had grounds to kill you based on the fact that you did not attack me, either."},{"postId":25923,"topicId":3269,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311187263,"postText":"He\'s played for awhile and knows about incen ammo, the fact that i didn\'t shoot you could just mean i didn\'t know where he got shot from, the fact he shot me INSTANTLY after he got hit makes me more worried bout him then anyone else even if i was inno. So all those facts just got negated because he\'s played for over a month and im not gonna be worried bout behind me when shot from the front. All im asking is a day ban since he didn\'t even slay himself after i said he rdm\'d me, no admin on means the topic went to ban requests."},{"postId":25930,"topicId":3269,"posterId":115,"postTime":1311190724,"postText":"It was a mistake, and therefore not ban worthy."}]}')}}]);
