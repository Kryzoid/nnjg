The game is amazing. The combat is still a bit like Oblivion\'s was, but the did a hell of an improvement to it. The revamped magic system kicks ass, though I wish I could find the rune magic D: i wanna set traps with mah spells D:\\n\\nThe stealth is also improved, as is archery and lock picking( it\'s more like fallout\'s style then Oblivion\'s). The animations are fucking gorgeous. Those are probably the best improvements to this game."},{"postId":37786,"topicId":4879,"posterId":373,"postTime":1321121274,"postText":">> I wish I could find the rune magic D: i wanna set traps with mah spells D: \\n\\n\\nRune magics can be bought from Ferange or whatever his name is at Dragonsreach, hope that helps :>\\nBut yeah the game is pretty fucking amazing and the dragons are awesome, I\'ve killed 21 of them as of\\nright now"},{"postId":37787,"topicId":4879,"posterId":812,"postTime":1321121997,"postText":"I\'m wondering if everyone else has the same textures as I.
