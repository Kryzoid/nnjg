I locked the first one, denied it, and removed the second and third.\\n\\nI permanently banned you because of a sarcastic post in the TerrorTown forum and for two spam unban requests (After your first was denied for a day ban). I\'m pretty sure you mistook the day ban as a permanent ban, because it doesn\'t unban at midnight. You  only  were banned for a day, but after the PM, the two spam unban requests after I denied the first one, and the sarcastic topic on the TerrorTown forum, I decided to permanently ban you from the server.\\nThis is showing that if you\'re banned for not following the rules on anything related to NNJG, as in the forum, you will be completely banned from the community. Ben unbanned you from the forum, but before he left he said he would re-ban you. I already talked to him with this, and you are staying banned. \\n\\nYou were a moderator, and know better then to break the rules. This is about you, not me, or anyone else in the community. I know you\'re going to say, or attempt to say, \\"But you break the rules all the time!.\\"\\nI don\'t, and that\'s always your excuse when someone says you break the rules. Within the first month of having you as a moderator, you had 3 ban/demotion requests. A lot of players were talking to me just to complain about you. It\'s obvious you can\'t follow the rules, whether on the forums or the servers, but we do not need this behavior here at nnjg.\\n\\nYour ban is staying, and the unban request denied. Ben agreed with me earlier, so \\"threatening\\" to talk to him like you did before won\'t do anything. I told you to talk to him, and I\'m not sure if you did. He agrees with me, and I would appreciate it if you didn\'t constantly post about this. \\n\\nIf you actually followed the rules, instead of always taking things into your own hands, you could actually play on our servers. But, when I first met you, people already started saying you revenge-killed. You say if an admin isn\'t on you\'re going to revenge-kill, which is against the rules. I asked why, and you said you didn\'t want to make a ban request or take screenshots.
