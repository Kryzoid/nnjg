Recently i was banned by the admin \\"Dum\\" for an offence that should have been MAYBE a slap for 50 dmg, at most, a slay. I then proceeded to talk to Dum about it and he kept saying that i didnt have a good enough reason to call him out when i clearly did. I was however wrong about what happened. Heres the full story:\\n\\nim putting this is \\"code\\"tags so its easier to read.\\n\\n  \\n         We were at the map gm_cliffhanger and it was pre-round. i was stuck on skiers head so that he could \\"launch\\" me in the the water. as they were pushing me to gain momentum, the round started. I was still on their head, and continuously being pushed. Then i get damaged by some one for 55 damage via goomba stomp. I looked back,I was right then release from skiers head FLYING across the map. i saw Dum (at the time named \\"Cow\\") walking away from the scene. (the timeing is hard to explain in typing but i saw him(well his player model) RIGHT BEFORE being launched then after being launched adjusted my mouse to see his name.) So thinking \\"Well how else could he goomba me for 55 dmg other than a rocket jump\\", so i called him out, with very reasonable suspicion. If i hadn\'t been falling to my death, i would have done more investigating, but in the short time i had in-air i could only utter the words \\"KOS cow\\". In my honest opinion, that is enough proof to call him out. He was then shot at for being called out, not killed. (correct me if im wrong here dum) The round ended and he asked me why i called him out. I told him my reason as i checked dmglogs and realised that it was some one else, by the name of Chevy. I have no idea how he goomba\'d me, but i didnt see him anywhere. But after that i told dum \\"Im sorry i called you out thinking it was you and it was actually chevy, slap me for 50 or slay me, my bad. He then banned me for an hour.    \\n\\nIf this had been between two people who weren\'t admin it would have been ignored, which is why i see it as abuse. I really think that Dum banned me becasue it happened to him on his traitor round, therefore abuse.\\n\\nI then had a steam chat with him, admittedly angry about being banned for something that was an honest mix up. i would post the steam chat heere but it will take up WAY too much space. so ill send it to an admin who needs it if the want to. If you need any further information just ask."},{"postId":29858,"topicId":3683,"posterId":101,"postTime":1313729242,"postText":"I asked you why you KOS\'d me.\\n\\nYou said \\" Because you weren\'t launching people  so I assumed you had a rocket <jump>.\\" (This was in chat)\\n\\nThen you tell me the real story after you were banned.\\n\\nEDIT: Also, you were attempting to talk over about 3 other people also using their mics.
