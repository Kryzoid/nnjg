There was no warning. I was not in game at the time.\\n\\nAdditional Information: The last time I played before being banned was Valentine\'s Day.At that time I was playing as a guard, and the only thing i see that might have got me banned was that a killed a prisoner. But i said into the mic before killing him to get to the back wall in 10 seconds. After not doing anything i killed him. I then played maybe 2 more rounds and left. Two days later I came back to play and it said i was banned.\\n \\nPlease unban me.

So you killed me, and then you left. I think I went a bit too much with the ban time, so I\'m going to unban you. But, the reason I banned was for rdming me and leaving, there was no reason for it, it was blatant, then you left. So I just banned your id for not wanting to play here. And before you did it, I banned someone for free killing or something, you said \\"fuck banners\\" then you free killed me and left. Just let this be a warning; don\'t free kill.\\n\\nEdit: That\'s not your steam ID, and I wont be able to get it. Go in a game, press \\"~\\" it links you to the developer console in game. Then type status. Find your name, and just copy and paste the whole line of what it says on your name.\\n\\nUnlocked."},{"postId":16201,"topicId":1950,"posterId":541,"postTime":1298240993,"postText":"Ok now I see why I was banned.
