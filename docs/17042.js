Immediatly after i kill him i get kicked saying Don\'t RDM. When i log back in he wont even listen to my story about y i killed him. I believe that he should no longer be a moderator until he learns what RDM really is. I would like everyone who agree\'s to type agree as a reply. And if i remember correctly the other day Brando told someone that it wasn\'t RDM because it was a traitor that was killed. I believe this shows he is abusing his power. He coulda just slayed me saying it was RDM but instead kicks me. Every other admin that ive seen would slay on a first account then ban if repeatadly done. Ill admit that ive been auto banned on several occasions. But every time i got auto banned it was from me defending myself from people trying to kill me.\\n\\nThank you for reading this, please reply if u agree with me or have any comments on this situation."},{"postId":3149,"topicId":331,"posterId":55,"postTime":1276892049,"postText":"did u saved logs ?"},{"postId":3156,"topicId":331,"posterId":79,"postTime":1276892778,"postText":"Wouldn\'t allow me to save after i got kicked, always been like that for me."},{"postId":3171,"topicId":331,"posterId":48,"postTime":1276913667,"postText":"Idk, i kind of agree that wasn\'t really an offense, because what you described seems like a fair amount of proof...\\nI really don\'t know what to say.\\n\\nIf he was made admin, that meant the 3 supers approved his app, and thought he was suited for the job...\\nBut he\'s been getting a bunch of complaints lately :S\\nidk. really, idk."},{"postId":3173,"topicId":331,"posterId":55,"postTime":1276914108,"postText":"yeh hard to agree or disagree or give his opinion about that"},{"postId":3835,"topicId":331,"posterId":68,"postTime":1277753251,"postText":"I am fine with him being mod, but he just needs a freaken brain that comes with it.

And bush had my knife. Some other dude had a knife. So after a minute or two, neo said to kill him. And he was a traitor. So then brando had banned him for 30 mins. Even IF it was rdm (which it wasn\'t) it was one kill, which WOULD NOT be a ban.\\n\\nhttp://i49.tinypic.com/2isoz6.png\\n\\nIt\'s blurry, but you can see what had happened. \\n\\nI posted this on another thread, but i\'ll delete it."},{"postId":3842,"topicId":331,"posterId":92,"postTime":1277759441,"postText":"I can vouch for this."},{"postId":3843,"topicId":331,"posterId":13,"postTime":1277766332,"postText":"I have heard many complaints about the way Brando is, seem it only a select few times. I liked him as a player, but as a mod, I think a demotion is in order. It\'s been looked over too many times, and I\'ve heard about him screwing up too many times. Staff has a certain standards and professionalism we have to stay up to, and he was failed to meet it on too many occasions. Most the bad stuff I heard about him was because he abused powers on players because they killed him, even if it was fair kill. Worse off was this time he did it on another staff member, if he did it too me I would\'ve banned him for it. I love The Big 3 personally, not just as supers, but I would not say just because they approved someone, they are actually competent for the job. A lot of people make great players, even regulars of a long time, but are shit once they get power. I urge you to consider his future as a staff."}]}')}}]);
