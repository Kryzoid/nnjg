Obviously not, video games need that intensity just like in sports, sure there is some buddying around, but there is also hatred and rivalries which fuel the desire to be the winner. Now I am not saying that gamers should completely kick decency under the rug, I agree that being an asshole for the sack of fucking with people is wrong...but I think without those people, games wouldnt be as fun. I support the campaign, but I disagree with trying to completely dismantle all smack talking."},{"postId":3514,"topicId":295,"posterId":153,"postTime":1277316410,"postText":"Make a new logo kinda like the one we have at http://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/bans "},{"postId":3580,"topicId":295,"posterId":12,"postTime":1277347263,"postText":"Whatd the difference?
