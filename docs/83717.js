As well I feel quite bad that when I\'m online, I\'m preventing others including him from being online. Now, normally I would just go out and buy the game, but seeing as my mom doesn\'t like me using her credit card online (the few steam games i have were won through contests, gifted to me, or gifted by an irl friend who i payed back at school the next day) I can\'t exactly do that.
