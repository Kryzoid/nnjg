One was Playerhata, one was Weegee. As you probably have realized, none of them play jail, and I told them that. However, they said they\'d try anyways. I say we use this thread to generally discuss the staff applications.\\n\\nI highly suggest we Deny Weegee. Almost every time I go on I hear a complaint of him trolling. Not to mention, he doesn\'t play Jail.\\n\\nPlayerhata has been a very good player. Though he does not play Jail either, I suggest we accept him for TTT also, because if any regular needs to be admin IN MY OPINION, Playerhata should be it.\\n\\nAlso on the topic of Domineeto, I don\'t see him on the servers much. Not to mention we discussed this before that we don\'t think he is ready to be admin. He has a reputation of trolling slightly and does not play Jail.\\n\\n\\nDiscuss thoughts on these 3 and other people who play Jail."},{"postId":29504,"topicId":3644,"posterId":2,"postTime":1313456179,"postText":"Who the hell unlocked applications?\\n\\nWe  do not need  more admins for TTT.
