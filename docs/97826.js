Lava, Metal, and Water. Each zone has a varied feeling to them, though I went a big overboard, and caused the file size to be fairly large (another reason I perfer my kinds of textures, smaller file size ;~;).\\nA T-tester is present, and thanks to all the confused players, it went back to being the basic press and test who is inside type of tester. This was too simple for me, so I decided to add in a method to destroy the T tester in the room under it (this room will be locked preround untill the round starts, to prevent trolls from destroying it too early). When this is destroyed, the T tester surges with energy, causing anything inside of it from thereafter to be severly shocked and tossed outside. Whoever breaks the T tester will become the damage owner (they gain the karma/points for the kill and show up in damage logs).\\nIn addition, easter eggs have been added to the map... 4 cubes, 2 weapons with display images, and an \\"infection panel\\".\\nThis infection panel is something special I\'ve cooked up. The very first player to touch it in a round becomes infected, to signify who is infected, I used some basic cubes to follow the player. The kicker, if the infected player retouched the infection panel, they move at 25% faster speed. This effect lasts untill the player dies... and for kicks, I left the cubes following the player till the next round.\\n\\nFeel free to comment about the map in this topic, otherwise, it will be lonely with only changelog replies ;~;\\n\\nAnd for some screens.\\nLava:\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688387004475/?tab=public\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688387009297\\n\\nMetal:\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688387001103\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688386997533\\n\\nWater:\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688390958488\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/631854688390968300"},{"postId":35744,"topicId":4554,"posterId":1099,"postTime":1319031793,"postText":"this looks like it would be bad-ass.

It\'s something new, not tested before... as such, I really wanted players to write out comments about it (and/or other parts of the map) in this topic, so I can get a good idea if it should be removed/kept/or expanded into other maps. This was assuming it would be added before I got online though XD... It appears this is not the case."},{"postId":35761,"topicId":4554,"posterId":4,"postTime":1319062171,"postText":"It\'s awesome in a retro way!"},{"postId":35806,"topicId":4554,"posterId":1087,"postTime":1319076284,"postText":"Okay. Wall textures are purple and black checkerboard in lava world, and the water world is completely checkerboard. The Infection really does help and isn\'t OP because the speed boost isn\'t super fast just enough to escape as traitor easier. That and the Lava pouring form the ceiling in the Lava world spins sideways not down like its falling. Gravity Non-Effective in udanes new map maybe. And possibly a traitor trap specific to each world, like some Mine craft Ghast T trap that shoots fireballs for like 1 minute. And for the water maybe Sharks that sit in the water for 2 minutes, or those Lil Half-life 2 leeches."},{"postId":35811,"topicId":4554,"posterId":605,"postTime":1319078302,"postText":"I am aware some textures not uploading in the map properly, and figured a way to fix it later.
