In gears of war 3 you are playing in the story line 1 year and 5 months after gears of war 2. The trilogy is all around story wise strong. Now once in awhile you will come across glitches but minor ones where it won\'t affect the game play and will make it more entertaining. Such as cans flying around (but not significantly ie flying across the map) and body physics just acting weird (such as when a body isn\'t gimped and leaning against the wall it will just act weird this is rare apparently). Beast mode is all round sound and is great when you are playing with 3 or four of your friends. Now the price tag is very well worth the money with amazing graphics, new modes, and simplified controls (which is a plus on my part), also on the side there is a \\"Season Pass\\" (which most games now these days are being offered) which will cost you about $30 and comes with a liquid lancer skin. Most of the skins that you can buy for your guns can be unlocked in specific events later in the year or can be bought this Microsoft points for around 340 Microsoft points, also some of the skins can be unlocked by certain achevements for example the chrome sawed off, you must complete all of the gears of war campaigns (1,2, and 3) or by reaching a certain level.\\n\\n==edit==\\nAlso there are two new versions of the campaign, Acrade (which basically gives you points for kills and you have to work together in order to progress and mutators, more will be explained in this edit) and standard (which I recommend you do first), also you can unlock stuff for your avatar by completing various achievements (which are all easy). As I stated before there are various additions which can add funny sounds or change the game play completely, one of these mutators are called laugh track, which causes a laughing sound in the background as you get a head shot on the A.I. (unlocked when you complete all 50 levels of the horde)\\n\\nAll around I give it 5 out of 5. \\n\\nReasons why:\\nPrice tag is great, Game play is very well sounded, and new stuff constantly being added."},{"postId":33956,"topicId":4268,"posterId":517,"postTime":1316577943,"postText":"Space marine spawned the gears, and the halo series thank them\\n, also space marine the game 5/5"},{"postId":34063,"topicId":4268,"posterId":237,"postTime":1316713221,"postText":"It\'s great!
