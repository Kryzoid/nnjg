When I went to play flood today, the server was populated by a group of people that knew each other and had like 500k betwean them. They teamed up and completely destroyed my boat in like 2 seconds with c4, rpg and other weapons. Its really stupid. They have twice the health as me and 5 times the firepower. Theres no way for me to make any money at all, since I can\'t pirate. Also, there was no admin on, and they were kind of ruining the game. Can someone find some way to change this?"},{"postId":6550,"topicId":731,"posterId":101,"postTime":1283293230,"postText":"Play something else for 10 minutes.
