Good news! About a year ago (More or less) I was in a different clan, called Havoc Gamers. Their clan died, (and they were assholes, believe me) so no worrying about them (I quit before they did.) However, I was making a map for THEIR jail server at the time, and I just found it today! I thought it was gone. In my opinion, it is a pretty good map, but it is not yet finished. However, my knowledge of Hammer has decreased since then, but I still remember a bit. I want one of you (if only UDane was back D:) to help me finish it!\\n\\nBefore we start, however, keep in mind, that although fun, and learning are the primary goals of all Hammer activities, serious awesomeness may occur.\\n\\n    THIS JOB DOESN\'T PAY MONEY. IT PAYS LOVE. ALSO IT IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS IN HAMMER/PEOPLE WHO ARE LEARNING IT. I WON\'T TEACH YOU   \\n\\nThis is what is on the map so far:\\n-Armory\\n-Outside Extravaganza\\n-Soccer Field\\n-Race\\n-[DELETED] Spray Contest (Sprays disabled D\'\'=)\\n-Disco\\n-Cells\\n-Obstacle Course\\n-Useless room near armory\\n-Kill room\\n-Half kill room half obstacle course\\n-A shitload more\\n\\n\\nHave some pictures.  http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumdadumdoo/screenshots/  All 82 are of the map.\\n\\nHowever, as I loaded it up today there is even more glitches than I thought it would be, probably from me making a stupid mistake from when I made it. The main one was a glitch in the skybox where it duplicated the map (sort of) into the skybox. That\'s why in the pictures it look really weird. I HAD to take it out since it kept running unbearably (spellcheck) slow if you looked in that direction.\\n EDIT: THIS IS FIXED \\n\\n\\nGlitches include:\\n\\n-Skybox duplicating the map, making it a shitfest  [FIXED] \\n-\'Lights\'\' for race aren\'t correct\\n-Water textures not appearing (It\'s as if you just kind of float there)\\n-A bunch of other shit that I may edit this post later to include\\n\\nWhat needs to be done:\\n\\n-Song needs to be put in disco. I can make it, but the person needs to help me put it in.\\n-Soccer goals (I had them at one point, I\'m not sure what happened to them)\\n-Solitary confinement pit needs to be fixed so the sliding brush is horizontal and not vertical (Not sure why this happens)\\n-Other stuff\\n\\nSorry there\'s a bunch of \\"other stuff\\", I\'ve been fixing the map for about an hour just so I can get screenshots, have had to go through about 10 compiles now.\\n\\n\\nTo apply, just put some stuff below that will make me want to work with you.\\n\\nI\'m only giving a map download link to people I\'m working with."},{"postId":21812,"topicId":2726,"posterId":115,"postTime":1305407161,"postText":"Udane was on like a week or two ago O.o\\n\\nAnd also, I\'m sure Bird could help you with some of it."},{"postId":21815,"topicId":2726,"posterId":101,"postTime":1305407820,"postText":"He supposedly quit the community."},{"postId":21817,"topicId":2726,"posterId":115,"postTime":1305408036,"postText":">> He supposedly quit the community. \\nHe QUIT the forums.
