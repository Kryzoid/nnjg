Removing the Deagles in my opinion would be a great and worthwhile decision on the server\'s part. The Deagle 1-2 shot kills anyone, and is way overpowered if four guards are running about one shot killing any prisoner disobeying. If not remove it, it should perhaps be made a VIP only gun, with a small spawn chance on guards?"},{"postId":36549,"topicId":4603,"posterId":481,"postTime":1319757175,"postText":"This was already done."}]}')}}]);
