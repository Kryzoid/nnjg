From what i read even though his grammar sucks is that he got kicked (appropriate response to issue). What was not the right thing to do was when he rejoins from the kick is to IMMEDIATELY gag/mute then ban him, the kick was the warning and from what he\'s saying. He didn\'t say a word after he came back in from the immediate gag/mute and ban. If anything the mod+ should be talked to about how to deal with situations and the ban maybe lifted if it was for over a week. (maybe dumb it down to a day ban) Again, forgive this post, but it seems he got banned right when he rejoined before he showed signs of doing something again.

It started when he told a younger person acting as warden to \\"Shut up\\", hence the first kick reason.  The 24 hour ban was from what he typed after he was gagged in chat.  Also, this ban is probably about to expire in a couple hours, or already has."}]}')}}]);
