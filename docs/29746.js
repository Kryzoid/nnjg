I have been going on daily to the Trouble in terrortown server, a friend of mine who has also been going on daily is Mr koiwai who can back me up on this statement. I usually see _crisis, domineeto and punkmind on the server. I have been VIP for a week and have decreased some the rdm that has been going on where there are no admins on. \\n6. With the ability to be moderator I could further decrease the amount of people who rdm and ruin the game for others. Also i am learning lua so I could help out on coding. \\n7. I want to be part of the NNJG team because of the reasons said before and because I want to know more of the people of the NNJG team. \\n8.
