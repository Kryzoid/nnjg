Then on the walls of said house, places enough torches to scare the baddies away?\\nOr if it\'s about fighting them, have you made yourself a sword and some armor? Also, you dont have to be rubbing them to hit them, the weapons hit from a bit far of a range."},{"postId":19626,"topicId":2459,"posterId":4,"postTime":1303771599,"postText":">> Why is minecraft so hard...

Im basically a big deal. Hahaha. I just play, but I can help you. Just add me. But, if you keep getting pawned change difficulty to peaceful til you got stocks of meat,armour,and weapons. If you want to save your stuff (In a way which is NOT cheating...)Look up minecraft inventory save it saves your inventory. You shouldnt need to DL something. Just goto minecraft.net sign into your profil, and change the skin. Again add me if you need help."},{"postId":20525,"topicId":2459,"posterId":634,"postTime":1304368076,"postText":"When I first started playing Minecraft I found this starter guide  helpful.\\nFor creating skins go here ."}]}')}}]);
