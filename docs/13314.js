I was playing on perp when someone adds me, I add them as stupid as I am.

The group had my IP on it, so I knew I was gonna get DDoSed or they wanted to fuck with my head. So after that, about 2-3 mins later, I\'m down. I told Gash what happened, he told me to reset my router. That didn\'t work to reset it. But either way, after about 5 mins, I was back up. I\'ll be calling my isp tomorrow to get my IP changed and inform them what happened.\\n\\nTLDR: I got DDoSed by some faggot who called me on steam\\n\\nTip to everyone: Don\'t add random people like I did.

So these people thought I ddosed their community. After getting DDoSed twice, I try to talk to Stebbzor, the one mentioned in the chat we had. He said he thought I ddosed his community and someone took action upon themselves and got my ip and ddosed me. It was a misunderstanding. But, through all this, my trolling days are over.\\n\\nSince you guys don\'t know, I\'ll fill you in. Over the past month or so, I\'ve been a troll. The furfag community I used to be in got ddosed everyday, trolled, etc. So it was dead. RoflWaffle was the one doing it. After a while, I decided to leave with deleting some posts and clearing the bans list. Then I trolled the fuck out of them. Every time they banned me, their servers went down. I asked Rofl to do it every time. So today I saw a message on the forums saying that some Jake kid, apparently DDoSed Rofl. So Rofl laughed because it wasn\'t true. He got on my forum account and said something. Then they were on vent. Rofl and I went on and trolled them. It got stale after a while, everyone left. Then I guess Stebbzor\'s servers went down, I don\'t know if it was rofl or not, and Stebb thought it was me. I guess one of his community admins/friends found out about it and added me. Me being stupid, added him. I showed you the chat. He DDoSed me. Then I got to talking to Stebb, he figured out who it was and talked them out of it, told him I don\'t know how to ddos and it was rofl. And everyone here knows I can\'t ddos, lmfao. \\n\\nAnyway, it\'s all settled and done with. I\'m glad it is. My dad just got up as he started DDoSing for the second time. And my dads a WoW addict. \\n\\nIf you don\'t wanna read it all, fu."},{"postId":11805,"topicId":1294,"posterId":26,"postTime":1292169252,"postText":"i add everyone who adds because me because im a nice guy and nobody would ever ddos me ^o^\\n\\ninb4gashddos\'sme"},{"postId":11806,"topicId":1294,"posterId":4,"postTime":1292183173,"postText":">> i add everyone who adds because me because im a nice guy and nobody would ever ddos me ^o^\\n\\ninb4gashddos\'sme \\nsame here\\nthe only enemy on steam i have to this day is mistur romans."},{"postId":11807,"topicId":1294,"posterId":54,"postTime":1292185131,"postText":"I was scared shit less when it happened :("},{"postId":11813,"topicId":1294,"posterId":2,"postTime":1292196007,"postText":"Who is your isp?"},{"postId":11819,"topicId":1294,"posterId":55,"postTime":1292202854,"postText":"Sounds bad .. wel..
