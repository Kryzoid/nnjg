You CANNOT play favorites. You may only act on proof given. Remember, witnesses are not proof, so neither are their stories.\\n\\nFor example: Crisis\'s recent ban request showed a log of an rdmer teamkilling two people.\\n http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/original.png \\nYou can look at the logs and say \\"Yeah, the guy did rdm two people, he deserves a ban.\\"\\nThen you sit back for a second, and think what would be an appropriate ban for this. Perhaps a day ban? Maybe longer if he\'s done it before. Probably less if he sincerely had no idea what he was doing.\\n\\nBut that\'s not everything. Look at ALL of the proof you have.\\n http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/seriously.png \\nWhy is it fair that  2 tks= Permanent ban, and 3 tks= Get off scot free?\\n\\nIf you were handed this log with no explanation, you probably would have banned them both.\\nThe only \\"backstory\\" was typed out with no actual proof of it ever happening. \\nI understand you guys probably know Crisis and that\'s why you accept bans like this, but you CANNOT play favorites.\\nIf some new guy joined the forums with the exact same screenshot (With his name replacing crisis) and the same story, nobody would approve it. (Well, they would approve it, and probably ban him as-well)\\n\\nIn short:\\n* Look at all the proof given in a ban request. Make sure you have enough. 1 teamkill and a hearsay story doesn\'t elicit a ban.\\n* No playing favorites. Treat everybody equally, no matter what your relationship with them. If the guy wants an unban and you\'re in the wrong its your ass on the line. Not his.\\n* Give out fair AND equal punishments. Be impartial. If two people break the same rule give them the same length of ban. Don\'t give one more time because you hate him.\\n* You can deny requests if you feel they don\'t have enough evidence.\\n* If you really aren\'t sure, either just wait or post saying so. Somebody else will come in and take it over."},{"postId":25203,"topicId":3176,"posterId":101,"postTime":1309749375,"postText":"Good thing I don\'t manage ban requests."},{"postId":25204,"topicId":3176,"posterId":272,"postTime":1309750173,"postText":"You know, I never payed any attention to anything that wasn\'t directly mentioned in the request, thanks for pointing this out, I\'ll be reading them much more carefully."},{"postId":25205,"topicId":3176,"posterId":101,"postTime":1309754613,"postText":"But an even CLOSER look at those 2 pictures....\\n\\n\\nCrisis killed the first guy seemingly on accident (200 damage in 1 hit?)\\n\\nThe second was the RDMer.\\n\\nThe third was someone who just traitor baited or something.\\n\\n\\nSo really, again, pay MORE attention to the ban requests...."},{"postId":25209,"topicId":3176,"posterId":2,"postTime":1309762705,"postText":">> But an even CLOSER look at those 2 pictures....\\n\\n\\nCrisis killed the first guy seemingly on accident (200 damage in 1 hit?)\\n\\nThe second was the RDMer.\\n\\nThe third was someone who just traitor baited or something.\\n\\n\\nSo really, again, pay MORE attention to the ban requests.... \\nYou\'re still making what you think happened based on his story."},{"postId":25215,"topicId":3176,"posterId":112,"postTime":1309781545,"postText":">> \\nThe second was the RDMer.\\n \\n\\nThat\'s fair.
