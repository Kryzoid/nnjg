I get rdmd so many times there it\'s not even funny. Mr. Addict was in there today and a few people rdmd but he did nothing. I find it quite sad that you have people representing this clan in your server when people are breaking the rules but nothing is being done. It really makes your clan look bad if the people representing it with the tags don\'t do shit about it and just sit there watching. If he\'s not a admin then he should have gotten a Admin in there or gotten a admin to ban him. If you guys had no Admins on at the peak of the server you should look into getting some."},{"postId":2302,"topicId":244,"posterId":12,"postTime":1275858144,"postText":"Not everyone who wears the tag is admin.
