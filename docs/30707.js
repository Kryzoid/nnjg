And even if they did I think this is something that would be left up to the staff (like it has).\\n\\n>> Alcatraz: opening it shouldn\'t be punishable, has a good 3 second wait time before you can enter or leave.  What other reason could they have for opening it than to let themselves/others into the armory? If you open the door it is an attempt to enter and therefore you can be killed if the guard decides to. \\n\\n>> This also means the tower outside is NOT guard area correct? There is some conflict there as well. On a defaut day the tower is open to anyone. A warden can restrict the area on any other day if he wishes to, unless the LR says not to.\\n\\n>> Hellz: (shed) I really think its cause guards are paranoid to the entrance to the sewer which is why its called off limits.  That area probably is more of a vent extension than a guard area, but since it\'s not a vent (it just leads to a vent) I just labled it as a guard area.\\n\\n>> (tower) I don\'t think players should get punished for jumping towards it unless they cross the red line, this will be hard to distinguish when you have those jump at it, get killed, and call RDM. Same goes for those who are just standing around near the base.  Jumping at the red plane and falling short is an attempt to enter the guard area. No one needs to jump there for any other reason. Standing around in the yellow area also has similar logic, people don\'t just stand around there, they stand there to let people in. Hence i put it down as such.\\n\\n>> Rock Solid: Yes oh yes get the guards off those stairs, that\'s all I ever see on the map is like 2 of them camping there claim its not guard area but shoot anybody who gets on it.  Guards can stay on the stairs all they want according to this list. Stairs are off limits to prisoners.\\n\\n>> Mars: I know prior to the server going down we had settled on catwalk which where the armory door starts is where guard area starts. If anything that button to open up armory is quite a distance considering you have guns focusing on you.  Who is \'\'we\'\'? According to this  thread, anything on the catwalk off the boxes or past the cell control area door is guard area.\\n\\nIf any changes need to be made to this an admin is free to edit the OP and make them."},{"postId":37992,"topicId":4900,"posterId":372,"postTime":1321413069,"postText":"I disagree with all of the catwalk of Mars around the box area being guard area.

No reason for prisoners not to be allowed around the rim of the box area. \\nIts easier to have a whole area blocked off by a doorway or separate floor than to have invisible lines gunning across the ground. If you want to change it, take a screenshot of the area draw tour own lines in and edit my post. I just think that the easier it is for people to remember the guard-to-prisoner area seperators the better."}]}')}}]);
