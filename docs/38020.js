I am quickly becoming more active on TTT again, and the forums. NNJG has become an important part of me, I love TTT, I love the people, I love the direction it is going. I want to keep the server friendly and fun.\\n\\n  10) Do you have any past experience with the position you\'re applying for:   Yes, I was a mod on NNJG\'s TTT for about a week or two, before being promoted to admin.
