During the month that Goldcraft was laggy (almost to the point of unplayable), many of our players left. \\n\\nMe, Pirate, and Tin have been asking around, and most of us agree that a new world would be in order -- meaning that we generate a new world, build Central-City 2.0 in Singleplayer, then let the server run the new world instead of our current one.\\n\\nOur current world has been through a lot, there\'s abandoned buildings everywhere, and most of the terrain near the spawn and CC is used. This would give us a chance to start fresh once again, with an actual reliable host such as the one we have now, with an astronomically better Central-City,  and our brand new goldcraft.org domain and IP!!! \\n\\n If this were to go through, all our Donators\'\' ranks would be kept, along with the same plugins and possible a couple more.  THE CURRENT WORLD WOULD ALSO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF OUR PLAYERS FOR THEIR SINGLEPLAYER MAPS AS WELL.  \\n\\nSo, what we\'re proposing is a vote. \\n Start with a new world , or  stay with the current one. \\n\\nThis would be a forum poll, but i would like this to be restricted to people on our whitelist.\\nTo vote, simply post a reply to this topic with your Minecraft ID, and your option of either  yes  or  no.  If you don\'t want to post, you can also send a message to me, Tin, or Pirate via Steam.

Some items will also be removed. Grief Protection will remain.\\n● The Nether will still be available if we switch to a new world.\\n● TNT will stay disabled.\\n● CC might be rebuilt in a Taiga biome at somewhat high elevation, or at water level near a beach if the world change were to occur. We could also take requests for the new design, or for a specific seed to start the new world on. The new CC would be built in a completely different way, with actually impressive buildings and a way better architectural design."},{"postId":18663,"topicId":2323,"posterId":2,"postTime":1302323453,"postText":"I worked too hard to gain all the stuff I have already, built what I made, and the whole point of having it built is so others can see it too.
