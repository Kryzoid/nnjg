In one case he threw and incendiary directly at Kilroy, Kilroy saw him do that and started shooting him. I asked him next round why he did that and he said \\"Kilroy shot me first\\" which was clearly not true being I witnessed the whole thing, and the damage logs. He just does not know when to quit.\\nAdmins on?:Nope.\\nProof?:\\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter1.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter2.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter3.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter4.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter5.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter6.jpg \\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/hunter7.jpg "},{"postId":31932,"topicId":3935,"posterId":54,"postTime":1315064463,"postText":"Thanks for this.
