Wait, what?! Do you think thats boring? For a pricey cost, they should be worth something!\\n\\nUpgrades? Yes!\\n\\n\\nOfcourse, when you buy a model you get a upgrade that comes with it!\\n\\n\\"But what happens with disguiser?!\\" Thats easy, you take the model! \\n\\nSo, what models do we have in mind? Me and Funny came up with these.\\n\\n\\nMario - Should be about 1000 - 300 points. Increases jump height by 5%\\nSonic - Should be about 100- 300 points. Increases speed by 5%\\nDuke Nukem - Should be around actually 300 points. - Its nothing but new sounds.\\nIsaac Clarke - Should be around 300 points - Its nothing but muffled version of the usual sounds.\\nGordon Freeman - Should be around 500 - 1000 points. -Upgraded crowbar push and damage.\\nSpongebob - Should be around 500 - 1000 points - Unlimited underwater breath\\n\\n\\nThis is ofcourse all the ideas we came up with, this thread is just for the idea and not post like \\"This is hard to code\\" or \\"Thats overpowered\\"\\n\\nFeel free to post a idea for a model!"},{"postId":16782,"topicId":2057,"posterId":2,"postTime":1299302909,"postText":"Good but difficult.
