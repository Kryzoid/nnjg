I mean how can you be in the server, it gets DDOSed every other day xD.

We have no personal animosity to Mr. gash, nor do we seek to attack him personally. This group\'s stated goal is to point out any admin abuse or highly \'\'unjust\'\' bans. We are here to attack admin abuse, not to hate on Mr. Gash. To those who think that is an anti-gash league, it\'s not: IT\'s an anti-admin abuse league and we seek to identify admin abuse.
