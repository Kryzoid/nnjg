CBA to check.)\\n 7) Why should we unban you or shorten your ban period:  As most things begin, I shall begin this appeal with a story. About 3-4 in the morning, my community\'s TTT servers were empty; They usually are around this time of day. So I opened my server browser to look for a TTT server with a decent amount of people.\\n\\nI found the NNJG TTT server. The server perplexed me at first, with it\'s strange weapons and features(Parkour?). But I stayed around because I knew that the servers that I frequent were probably still empty. After a few rounds, it became clear that I was head and shoulders above the skill level of most people on the server. (Not trying to brag, stating it how it is.) How exceptionally well I was doing was just as a shock to me as it was to the server populace. Nearly every time I got traitor the round ended with nearly all of the server being single handedly taken out by me.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995233666/screenshot/649869086973532843/?\\n\\nAnd on top of that, when ever I was innocent I seemed to be in the right place at the right time to kill off the traitors before they could do much harm. After a few rounds of this, the animosity of some of your mods was beginning to become clear to me. About the second map during my stay on your server, someone named \'\'Baliente\'\' joined, and stayed in spectator. After a few minutes it occured to me that he was probably here on complaints of aimbotting. I giggled inside a little. I was still very pleased, and proud of my performance on how I was dominating the server. Baliente left, and at this point I was still not banned. I assume this is because he had decided that I was in fact, not hacking. The next map was even more one sided in my favor. Near the end before the map change I had 61 points and 0 deaths. Baliente, in evitably, came back in, probably because of more reports of the same.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995233666/screenshot/649869086973583154\\n\\nThe last round before the change I was finally killed. I was camping a hallway and the detective managed to hit me with a flaregun. (No idea where he got it from.) Which immensely ruined my aim. Once I was extinguished, I popped around the corner, only to be flared again, at which point I charged him with my desert eagle, leading to my first, and final death on the map. The detective, who was also a moderator, proudly marched around in the after round declaring \\"I killed the aimbotter!\\". The map changed, and I received a message saying that I had been banned.\\n\\nNow, allow me to explain how I was doing so well; from what I hear, the server was having problems with the weapons on each map. (Your problem most likely being the rearming script that gives most TTT maps their weapons.) Point in case, at the beginning of every map, I would locate a desert eagle, and then every round after that I would make a bee-line straight for it. This gave me an advantage over other players in the server because it ultimately resulted in my ability to kill them with a single shot. Other players most likely did not have the fortune to locate a weapon that they were comftorable with using. I myself am extremely comftorable with the behavior of the desert eagle, and so, did not have the same acclimation problems as other players. As unprobable as it may seem, I have not, and never will use hacks, aimbots, or any other sort of third party material that would give me an advantage over other players. I\'ve played TTT for a little over two years now, and I\'ve ran in a scrim team in CSS (Though I\'ll admit, I wasn\'t exactly pro material).\\n\\nThe only reason I am making this appeal is that I have a spotless record, that is unblemished. This is the first time I\'ve ever been permanently banned from a community (Or a server, for that matter.) So I feel it\'s only just that I take it very seriously. I most likely will not be visiting your servers very often. It\'s not that they\'re bad, or that I feel estranged by the course of events that have transpired, it\'s that I normally play in a community much like the community here, and I\'m a part of that community\'s leadership. (Administration, management of the community, Advisory to higher-ups.)\\n\\nAs a person who enjoys playing in tightly knit communities such as these, I ask that you repeal the ban that you have given me.\\n\\nThank you all for taking the time to read this, and I do hope you reach a favorable decision.\\n~[REDACTED]"},{"postId":36175,"topicId":4626,"posterId":1147,"postTime":1319371482,"postText":"Forgot to post my Steam ID: STEAM_0:0:17483969"},{"postId":36204,"topicId":4626,"posterId":373,"postTime":1319419740,"postText":"Yes, I was speccing you due to the complaint of one of the users on the server. I wasn\'t surprised by your kill count due to most of our regulars \\ngetting 5-7 kills per traitor round, it\'s the fact that every one of your kills was a headshot except for one which was gunned down by an m16. \\nWhile I was speccing you it looked like a genuine aimbot while you headshotted a falling innocent mid-air. Just about every other one of your\\nkills was a miss 2 shots, immediately get a boom headshot. \\n\\nI banned you over the web when I left so I can only assume it took awhile to reach the server to tell it that you were banned.

As I was saying before when targets only bother to strafe and think it\'s going to save them; but they only have one plane of movement, meaning I have less work cut out for me as I only have to set my crosshairs head level and then aim horizontally and headshot them. My aim is good, perhaps better than most, but I wouldn\'t go so far as to say it resembled an aimbot. I\'m assuming that you\'ve already done your research and used a web crawler to search for any web pages with my STEAM ID on them. If so, then you can already see that I have no record of hacking ever, and a near non-existant record of being banned.\\n\\nIf that isn\'t enough for you, what is there that I can do to lift this ban?\\n\\nP.S. : The moderator that was marching around talking about how he killed me was named \\"Doctor\\" Something-or-other and had an orange name. Perhaps this means he was a donator; I\'m not sure. I\'m not too familiar with your system of colored names."},{"postId":36238,"topicId":4626,"posterId":612,"postTime":1319476939,"postText":"Me?

Just because I was doing incredibly well does not mean that I was hacking as you seem to believe, even if I am getting headshots. If I was truely so blatantly aimbotting then I would have been well able to kill you regardless of whether you set me on fire or not. Not only that, but I would have never even been damaged. Most of the time I was knocked down to half health or worse, and I did miss from time to time, such as when an innocent climbed up a ladder I switched to my M4 because it would just be easier to spray him down. I have over a thousand hours on TTT: http://screensnapr.com/v/lK8Ggt.png\\nOf course I\'m going to be good at it. I mean, come on, think a little here. As for \\"Locking on bad\\" How would I lock onto anything if it\'s a one shot kill? Locking-on is defined in it self as tracking a target exactly without flaw. I\'ve missed 3-4 shots before killing someone before. How do you claim that to be \\"locking on?\\".\\n\\nAs well as that, when I first joined the server on the map \\"The Thing\\", one of you exploited your way out of the map and then into the woods. I found their general location using my radar, but beyond that I was not able to locate them. If I was truly aimbotting I would have shot him through the treeline regardless of whether my vision was obscured or not. From this point on, I\'d like it if you would not interject with such a poorly thought out statement. I would like it more if I could get a response from the banning admin to get his judgement."},{"postId":36350,"topicId":4626,"posterId":612,"postTime":1319581000,"postText":"the fact that you didnt kill me whilst on fire doesnt mean you werent hacking, just that you were hiding it. look, if you hadnt been locking on so badly, i wouldnt have caught a thing. but you would miss twice then lock on. we ALL saw it."},{"postId":36418,"topicId":4626,"posterId":1147,"postTime":1319635084,"postText":"As stated before, I do not hack, and never will. Therefor your interjection really is meaningless. My persecution in itself is ridiculous in this situation, as a snap shot or a flick is nothing to even resemble an aimbot. You all obviously have no sense of fair trial in this community, as I see no evidence presented, only a member blathering about how blatantly I was hacking and an administrator that will not even respond. Maybe when this community grows a bit you\'ll see the value in not allowing here-say testimonies. The manner in which I have been banned is unjust in itself, and the support from the staff is lack-luster at best. I came here to lift my first and only permanent ban that was placed for an absurd reason. No matter how good I am, I should have the privilege to play TTT without being accused of \\"AIMBOTZZ! LULHAKX\\". I\'d suggest the owner of this community take a serious look at the way staff handles complaints and begin implementing anti-bias measures. Where I\'m from, whenever we ban a hacker we take a demo or a recording of his offense and when it is appealed the demo/recording is presented as evidence to eliminate a prejudiced trial. Because that\'s exactly what this has been. The administrator had decided my fate before even opening this thread. I\'m sure I\'m not the only one who has been left to such a fate. The experience here has been bitter and frustrating, so I can only hope you all do something to change that for your future visitors. With that, I will leave you. At least you all won\'t have to suffer the minor inconvience of being killed in a video game by someone who is more skilled than you. Instead, it\'s much more convenient to ban them for \\"Hacking\\" and take a stab at their reputation that will follow them back to their gaming community, isn\'t it?"},{"postId":36427,"topicId":4626,"posterId":612,"postTime":1319650732,"postText":"It\'s weird because you say we don\'t have evidence. I\'m pretty sure you don\'t have any evidence that you weren\'t hacking. Either way, I got SEVERAL steam messages about you cheating before I even grabbed balenti. I then spectated you for about 20-30 minutes and I kept seeing the same pattern. Miss miss snap-on. And here\'s a tip. If you are trying to get unbanned, don\'t criticize the system in which we operate. You are just some random kid who join the server by accident. You were cheating. And you were justly reprimanded. /thread."},{"postId":36492,"topicId":4626,"posterId":373,"postTime":1319696644,"postText":"After a lengthy discussion with a staff member about the matter we\'ve come to reach the verdict\\non your appeal; it was decided that you must have been aimbotting.\\n\\nLocked and Denied."}]}')}}]);
