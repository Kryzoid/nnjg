As an inno im trying not to get killed, and would do anything to not die (aside from breaking rules obv). This thread is basically so i know where the line is for trucing. As i\'ve taken parts in these hastage situations MANY times, ive even held Udane hostage. And it was  a co-owner  Kryzoid who invented these scenarios. I\'m just trying to figure it out because it seems silly that we are forced to hack away at a traitor while they have a knife. you cant force an inno to kill some one."},{"postId":37579,"topicId":4830,"posterId":735,"postTime":1320876304,"postText":"This along with C4 Roulette needs to be defined as what is trucing and what is not."}]}')}}]);
