I spend a lot of time on this server, in fact all the hours logged into garrys mod are from the JB server.\\n\\nPicture evidence of people approving:\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app1.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app2.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app3.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app4.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app5.jpg <- contains three approvals\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app6.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app7.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app8.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... 3/app9.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... /app10.jpg\\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx20 ... /app11.jpg\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/stratos83/ ... tab=public\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/stratos83/ ... tab=public"}]}')}}]);
