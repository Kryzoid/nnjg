Many people dunno how to get unstuck and most of the time no one is on to fix the issue. Also, calling someone a cunt is like calling someone a bitch or asshole. It\'s minor disrespect but nothing to be banned over. If it was then their needs to be a hell of a lot more bans.\\n\\nMainly posting this to let him know that their are ways to get unstuck tho. Hasser, if you get stuck for any reason from a tp or other reasons, take out your magno stick and repeatedly left click. Each click moves the person roughly 1 pixel length away and allows you to eventually get unstuck."},{"postId":34305,"topicId":4311,"posterId":812,"postTime":1316999544,"postText":">> lol where did I say that Treecko was rdming? nowhere did I say that.

So being that you\'re stuck that justifies RDM? I said I was teleporting people over mic also.\\n\\nAnd how do you debate a fact? And nice ban evasion, this is literally your SIXTH time in one day trying to contest the same ban.\\n\\nAnd regardless, that\'s not even what you\'re banned for, you\'re banned for disrespect. I\'m locking this AGAIN.\\n\\n@Crisis. He went directly to admin chat after I slayed him and said \\"You dumb cunt\\". If that\'s not staff disrespect, I don\'t know what is."}]}')}}]);
