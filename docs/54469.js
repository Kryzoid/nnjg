(less of a hardass version of moderation this time around)\\n9) Why do you want to be part of the NNJG Team: Of the servers out there, this one has the best community and extras. I want to help make this server even better.\\n10) Do you have any past experience with the position you\'re applying for: I\'ve admined a few other servers before, and was a temp admin while gash was on vacation till I banned his alt.\\n11) Do you own a decent microphone, and do you frequently utilize it: Yes, alot\\n12) Any other comments or information you can provide: Ben asked me directly to post this here, mostly because I\'ve been getting tired of rdmers n such having free reign during the nights (midnight-7am). All I\'m really after is stopping the blatant rdmers, trucers, etc. from causing as bad a problem as they used to during said time.\\n\\nBecause of the timezone I tend to play in, its nearly impossible for me to get the number of recommendations required. Just as I\'m well aware the community is pretty half n half about me. \\nThe fact is, we need someone during the nights to keep the server safe while the other admins sleep, be it me or someone else."},{"postId":31061,"topicId":3805,"posterId":4,"postTime":1314500153,"postText":"The lack of recommendations will be excused as your provided explanation was reasonable."},{"postId":31075,"topicId":3805,"posterId":153,"postTime":1314504572,"postText":"I recommend him, if that matters XD"},{"postId":31956,"topicId":3805,"posterId":2,"postTime":1315081861,"postText":"Denied as per request by Udane."}]}')}}]);
