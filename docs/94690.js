I then stopped, thinking, \\"Hey, maybe this is an admin thing instead.\\" He was near death at that point, so I tried to ask, very urgently, whether this was a traitor weapon or him using his admin powers, to which I got no response. This was made very difficult since my mic kept running out. Not 30 seconds later, I was banned for RDMing. If this was about shooting the admin, well, I think it\'s pretty understandable what happened. Maybe I deserved a slay, but a week long ban? I didn\'t even kill him. Furthermore, turning yourself invisible mid round would seem to me like using admin powers for your own in game advantage, which I would consider to be pretty shady, but that\'s not up to me. I was not even asked about any of this, my first and only notice of an issue was when I was banned.\\n\\nIf it was about an incident two rounds or so before that, where I killed two innocents, I can easily explain that as well. The first innocent I shot killed a confirmed innocent right in front of me. The second was shot by someone else when he was near me, and must have assumed I was the one who shot him, so he started shooting me, and I defended myself. Obviously that\'s unfortunate but what was I supposed to do?"},{"postId":32671,"topicId":4048,"posterId":605,"postTime":1315464872,"postText":"This was not about this case you brought up, this was from the multiple rounds, not one or two, of rdm beforehand.\\nBut even if we were to argue on your point, you did not once ask what I was using, not one word, be it in the mic or typed. I will concede your ignorance of the cloaker, a weapon anyone can purchase, as a simple willfull ignorance. \\nOn the 2nd point of this topic, no, I am not an admin. Gold names are admins, blue names are moderators, and oragne names (my name\'s color) are vips.\\n\\nWhile we are here, might as well point out, it\'s also offensive to hear/read kos(which im certain your going to ask what kos is, so, kill on sight) god.\\n\\nFunny how talkative you are now about what occured after the ban, but not during the server while it was occuring."},{"postId":32722,"topicId":4048,"posterId":1075,"postTime":1315524267,"postText":"No, there were not multiple rounds of RDM. There was the instance with the two innocents I killed as an innocent which I explained, and the racist guy who would not respond to any questions about his health or respond to live checks when I was a detective. That\'s all. Can you provide specific instances otherwise? Because I\'m sure I can defend them. \\n\\nFurthermore, I was talking the whole time, then, and before that in the game. I did ask you what you were doing, in voice chat, several times. I yelled at first about it, then started shooting you, stopped shooting you and started asking again. Others didn\'t seem to have any issue hearing me, so I\'m not sure what your issue was. Of course I did use up all of my mic bar so I probably cut out a bit, but I certainly did ask. I enjoy talking in game, and if anything, people complain that I talk too much! Tonight, I\'ll try to find some way to demonstrate that your assertion which this ban is predicated on to be false. I do have demos but GMod crashes every time I try to convert them into a video.\\n\\nAlso, please don\'t patronize me. A cloaker is an uncommon mod which I haven\'t encountered on other servers in quite awhile, if ever. Calling my ignorance of it willful is betraying a lack of understanding of people who might not play frequently on one specific server with a very unique set of modifications. I wouldn\'t expect you to know about every single SWEP, etc., on every other TTT server you\'ve played on, and I think it\'s unreasonable to criticize me for not meeting such a ridiculous standard.\\n\\nFinally, ignoring the continued patronizing by explaining to me what KOS means, you are the first person in over a year of my playing TTT with the name oh god, to find it offensive. I mean, would the name Jesus be offensive because someone might say KOS Jesus? That is another absurd standard. This is the Internet, and in comparison to pretty much anything offensive that can happen in game or out, this has to be one of the mildest."},{"postId":32742,"topicId":4048,"posterId":1075,"postTime":1315535570,"postText":"I\'d also like to address your last little snipe, about how it\'s \\"funny\\" that I\'m so talkative now. I\'ve already addressed that I  was  talking then, but frankly your general attitude here is incredibly unnecessary. How was I supposed to talk about this beforehand when I was banned without warning? Without any of these supposed concerns being brought up to me, even once? I was playing the game, using voice chat normally, talking about in game things. At no point that I can see, was it ever mentioned that there was any problem with me supposedly RDMing. In fact, the only moment I became concerned that there might be some misunderstanding was in the last thirty seconds before I was banned, during our incident with your cloak usage. And I was talking then, simple as that. \\n\\nI know there are some nasty and awful players on TTT, but that is no reason to treat every player like dirt. I\'m a kind and respectful person. I won\'t say I take TTT seriously, but I don\'t mess around. You should consider being more understanding of what people are experiencing, instead of going on a self righteous crusade against anyone who might possibly have done something wrong, no matter the reason. It\'s called empathy, and it\'s a part of normal human interactions. You should probably consider having some."},{"postId":32748,"topicId":4048,"posterId":1075,"postTime":1315538695,"postText":"I watched the demo of the entire round again, and the three times I killed innocents as an innocent are exactly the three I described in the original post. There was a lot of RDMing going on which I was not involved in and which went completely unpunished, like the innocent who killed a detective and left, and was never banned. I even remember discussing the incident on voice chat and I can produce screenshots of that. He has a completely unjustified RDM, against a detective no less, and leaves, facing no punishment. I have three innocent kills over an entire map, which I have justified. That deserves a week long ban? There was other RDMing going on as well and going by your source bans page, those people are similarly unpunished. Yet here I am. \\n\\nI\'ve attached three screenshots showing that Udane is incorrect in his description of the events. They show the time when Udane was cloaking and when I shot him. They also, surprise surprise, show me using voice chat. I can go through the very long demo* again and try to get clearer screenshots, but I believe these state my case well enough.\\n\\n* Note, very long and yet only 3 innocent kills. It is the third longest demo I\'ve ever recorded, and I have 140 demos total. Show me someone who hasn\'t ever killed 3 innocents over the course of 10 rounds (or more, I didn\'t count) or so. It happens and it doesn\'t mean the player is necessarily in the wrong.\\n\\nThe first screenshot, when I am asking urgently if cloaking is a traitorous act:\\n http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/904/2011090800002.jpg  \\n\\nSecond screenshot, you will notice that I\'m shooting a cloaked person, and that my mic bar is also low, indicating that I have been talking recently:\\n http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/1627/2011090800004.jpg  \\n\\nThird screenshot, showing Udane wounded, and again I am talking:\\n http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/5092/2011090800008.jpg  "}]}')}}]);
