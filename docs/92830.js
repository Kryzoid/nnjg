Noire - Rockstar Games \\n\\nBecause I\'m too lazy to type L.A. every time I\'m referring to the game, I will type in Noire instead. Noire is a brilliant game set in the 1940s, where you play as detective Cole Phelps, a veteran from WWI who became a cop afterwards. This game is hardly like any other, with the combat at minimal. The first complaint I have, before we begin, is that this is more of a linear game slapped into a free-world engine. Doesn\'t go well.\\n\\nAs Phelps progresses through his career, he solves many (usually murder) cases. The cases at first are very fun, but over time get a bit repetitive. You go to the scene, get clues, go to the victims home and interrogate them, go to suspect, chase suspect, done. Later on the cases get a lot longer, sometimes taking over an hour. Earlier ones are usually 15 minutes (VERY early ones.)\\n\\nLet\'s start with the step. You get a cutscene seeing a section of the murder, you get called to go to the scene. When looking for clues, there is soft music playing in the background. When in crime scenes, the clues are fairly obvious as they have already been looked at, you just have to connect it (excluding the occasional clue on the body.) At houses of suspects, however, this is much more difficult, as you can pick up things that aren\'t relevant. This process is fairly boring after a while, and consists of you looking around and spamming the A (on xbox) button everywhere. If the clue is of relevance, Phelps just automatically says a line and you get the clue added. If you have to interact a bit with the object, you can turn it around or if it is like a purse you can open it. While doing this, it is VERY obvious if you have a clue, as it activates a unique audio clue AND flat out tells you in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. It makes it a bit too easy finding what is a clue and what isn\'t.\\n\\nThe interrogating on the bright side is much more remarkable. Rockstar boasted beforehand that they made the technology to put peoples\'\' faces into the game to show emotion. While looking at trailers, I kind of thought \\"Meh, looks OKAY.\\" But  damn  does it actually look good. No longer do you see stupid lip synching. It is PERFECT. Anyways, in interrogations, you ask the person a bunch of questions, and they respond with their answer. Depending on their story and how they are acting when they say it, you can decide on 3 options: Truth, Doubt, or Lie. The truth is obviously if they are telling the truth, the doubt is if you think they are lying but have no evidence, and Lie is if you have evidence. After you pick one, it tells you whether you were right or wrong. Really the only thing that matters about it is the score. But who\'s ever given a SHIT about the score you get. I only found about 4 times where it actually MATTERED if I got it wrong. I\'ve gotten all 4 wrong and it hasn\'t done shit. A problem I had though is that the Truth and Doubt (the one you\'re picking 95% of the time) are VERY picky, as sometimes you think \\"THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH HIS STORY\\" when you select truth and it hits lie. Often people are withholding part of the story they have, so it\'s doubt. Other-times they aren\'t, so it\'s truth. But you can NEVER TELL WHICH ONE IT IS. In fact half the time you pick truth you might as well would have had the same out come as doubt.\\n\\nChase+Fight scenes are generally okay. There\'s 4 kinds of it: Brawling (fists), Gun fights, Car Chases, and Foot Chases. Sometimes car and foot chases change into each other. The brawling is pretty boring. A to punch, hold X to block, tap X to dodge, Y to grab and some other weird things. It\'s pretty basic and you can pretty much win by spamming A. Foot chases are also pretty boring. Just hold right trigger (sprint) until you get near the guy, then tap A. In car chases you just follow the guy and try and knock him off the road. Pretty basic, but it\'s REALLY hard to follow them if you make a small mistake, such as crash into a small wood picket fence that you were supposed to drive in a small gap through. There\'s almost no point in trying after that. You\'re screwed half the time if you take too long. The gun fights are VERY rare and usually happen only in street crimes (if you are driving and you hear a radio say there\'s a crime, you can respond to it.) It uses a system almost identical to Red Dead Redemption\'s, being based around cover. However, it is much worse than RDRs. It is awkward, you can\'t tell how to use the controls correctly, and is generally very unsatisfying.\\n\\nOne thing I wanted to discuss was that Noire generally doesn\'t feel like it should be an open world game. The locations are fairly simple, and you can almost always just get your partner to drive, skipping the 5 minutes it could take. I honestly didn\'t have much fun with the world. In fact the most satisfying thing I did was just to either shove random citizens to the ground (also a bit buggy. You could just be walking slower than a snail into somebody and they\'d be sent flying back, or running faster than a leopard and they\'d just be nudged to the side.) or trying to get myself run over (takes about 20 times to actually kill yourself, and you have to time it perfectly or else the cars will move out of the way.)\\n\\nNoire is one of the games where you kind of play an hour at a time, and not take it on in a day.\\n\\n  GOODS AND BADS  \\n -Phenomenal voice acting\\n-Phenomenal face acting\\n-Great and unique story\\n-Characters have great personalities\\n-Incredibly long (comes on 3 disks for the xbox 360, holy shit) \\n -Repetitive\\n-Bad combat system\\n-Kind of buggy\\n-Bad open world\\n-Bad \\"tutorials\\" (HERE READ THIS SMALL TEXT IN 10 SECONDS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DOING WHAT IT SAYS THAT YOU CAN\'T EVEN READ PROPERLY IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING UNDER HDTV!)\\n-Not entertaining for long periods of time\\n-Too many unskippable and long cutscenes\\n-An incredible amount of long loading screens \\n\\n  Verdict: 8 out of 10. Definitely rent this for a week.  \\n\\nAlso note that I probably have a lot more of both the goods AND the bad, I\'m just too tired to think of them. Also, don\'t think that because there are more bads then there are goods, it\'s a bad game. It\'s definitely a great game, just has a lot of SMALL things that could be better.\\n\\nNext review: Red Dead Redemption"},{"postId":32172,"topicId":3992,"posterId":48,"postTime":1315205545,"postText":"L.A. is 4 characters.\\nNoire is 5. :P \\n\\nYou sure are lazy xD\\n\\nAnyways, on topic here, great review.\\nReally in depth and seems like you covered a lot.\\n\\nI also like how you do pros/cons.\\nDefinitely sounds like something I might want to rent, but not sure if I\'d want to own.\\nI\'ll get back to you on this if I do rent it.  :)"},{"postId":32175,"topicId":3992,"posterId":101,"postTime":1315207105,"postText":">> L.A. is 4 characters.\\nNoire is 5. :P \\n\\nYou sure are lazy xD\\n\\nAnyways, on topic here, great review.\\nReally in depth and seems like you covered a lot.\\n\\nI also like how you do pros/cons.\\nDefinitely sounds like something I might want to rent, but not sure if I\'d want to own.\\nI\'ll get back to you on this if I do rent it.  :) \\n\\nThere\'s no reason to own it.
