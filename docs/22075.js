Was deciding between this and Fallout 3. Figured since I already have new vegas, I\'ll go for something new.\\n\\nMetro 2033 takes place in Moscow, Russia. When Russia was engaged in nuclear war, 40,000 of its people fled to the Moscow metro system. This game has a few wow moments, and is well worth the money if you enjoy first person shooter games that have nothing but russian accents.\\n\\n http://physxinfo.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/metro_2033_4-300x168.jpg \\n\\n http://physxinfo.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/metro_2033_5-300x187.jpg \\n\\nOn a scale of 10, I would give this game an 8. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is superb, and the storyline is the best I have seen since, well, Half Life 2. The only downfall is its short. I\'m almost done with the game, in fact. \\n\\nSo yeah, very short review, don\'t really want to spoil any of it. Your name is Artyum though, and you end up going through the metro, fighting bandits and monsters, to save your homeland, and to deliver something..."},{"postId":16277,"topicId":1968,"posterId":82,"postTime":1298406288,"postText":"His name his Artyom, and near the bottom \\"its\\" is spelt \\"it\'s\\" not \\"its\\" other than that, great review."},{"postId":16294,"topicId":1968,"posterId":373,"postTime":1298428722,"postText":"You\'re fighting to defend the Mother Land?"},{"postId":16304,"topicId":1968,"posterId":54,"postTime":1298448139,"postText":"I have this game, but I never have played it.... time to download it!"},{"postId":16334,"topicId":1968,"posterId":115,"postTime":1298503100,"postText":">> His name his Artyom, and near the bottom \\"its\\" is spelt \\"it\'s\\" not \\"its\\" other than that, great review. \\n\\nThank you mr grammar nazi.\\n\\nBtw there are nazis in here.
