He said so and so is traitor about 7 times so when I saw him, I killed him then ID\'d his body.  I was immediately killed and banned, without any chance to argue my case and none of the moderators let me plead as they ignored my friend requests.

A day ban is too lenient for someone who wants both stories heard but will only listen to his own story. A month ban would be the lowest I would have recommended at that point, after he then tried to RDM a few more times, i believe the Perma ban was the right thing to do. (Was witness to entire thing). Back in the day he woulda been perma\'d instantly after revenge. So it was lenient till he continued."},{"postId":18647,"topicId":2314,"posterId":2,"postTime":1302314044,"postText":"Late, but I unbanned him."}]}')}}]);
