Note: This is not an attack on any other TTT admins/mods... But it might be part rant.\\n\\n He doesn\'t step on the toes of VIPs. \\nTo many times I have !gaged someone for racism just to have it overturned by another mod or admin. I get it, you weren\'t there. How are you supposed to know what spectators are saying. But, by !gaging them they are forced to display there racism in the comment box. Instead, in no-time-flat an Admin/Mod will !ungag said person after I tell them they where being racist. Now, I don\'t expect you to ban them on my word over what they said on there mic. (can\'t prove unless I have my fraps running, therefor hardest to prove, and therefor understandable) But at least respect the !gag. If a mod found someone race hatein\'\' that almost always ends in a perma. Yet here is a chance a person is being racist, AND they still get !ungaged. See, I don;t know what the problem is. Maybe mods and admins have a hard time trusting vips, and would rather side with a racist. I don\'t know, and I don\'t pretend to. BUT I have never had this experience with Overclocking... And its the reason I think he is a good mod.\\n\\n He asks around. \\nNow its not my place to start making a list of people who do or don\'t ask around the server to see weather a story one person is giving about another before a ban is made. I personally think its a good idea, and I\'m GLaDOS that he bothers to double check.\\n\\n Kind of sounds like a woman. \\nWith so many male admins it shows that at least NNJG is trying.\\n\\n Calm and cool Headed \\nThis is something that all TTT admins should have. And I can say that ALMOST all of them do. Overclocking being within\'\' the top of the most cool headed. Though he isn\'t always all that calm... But then again... Look who\'s talking, ME! I have been know to scream non-sence until my mic-limit goes out. And still no one could understand who the Traitor was.\\n\\n Overall, or should I say Overclocking... I give him a 4.9/5 \\nPerfection is the hardest thing to reach."},{"postId":24100,"topicId":3031,"posterId":397,"postTime":1308120175,"postText":"i gave him a 4.7"},{"postId":24102,"topicId":3031,"posterId":79,"postTime":1308120605,"postText":"I personally gave him a 3, but told him average Admins I would give a 2"},{"postId":24103,"topicId":3031,"posterId":237,"postTime":1308125131,"postText":"I gave him a 5.
