Thus having 8 overall if also looting credits. another traitor kills said detective, gaining 8 + 1 to they\'re current credits, meaning 10 if not used. then they kill the OTHER detective for a total of 12.\\n\\n12 is the maximum obtainable amount ever and you have to be either flawless and gain all credits from traitors and detec and killing bonuses from each (aka will never happen unplanned).\\n\\nafter all that hard work, you get 10hp per vial, but keep in mind you can only hold one at a time.\\n\\nsuch a bitch thats not worth it in the opinions of many, right"},{"postId":11270,"topicId":1209,"posterId":39,"postTime":1290805289,"postText":"I say we just make the health station give back 25 health.\\nIts a fair amount especially considering your spending hard earned credits on it."}]}')}}]);
