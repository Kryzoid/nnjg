I can\'t believe you are all getting on Brando\'s shit about this. This is not an admin abuse problem, this is a player to player conflict. If you don\'t like someone, it is your Valve given right not to have to hear them, and I don\'t remember anyone telling me just because we are admins, means we have to take extra shit from someone and can\'t player side mute people on our nerves. If it were me I would skip the mute and kick anyone, VIP or not, for admin disrespect.\\n\\nIf Derp has getting rdmed and Brando was only admin on server that could help him and was ignoring him, ignoring his staff obligation, then it would be a problem, but if it is just petty bickering between two people, he has no obligation to hear trolling on him, and he didn\'t !mute or !gag him so he didn\'t abuse, and shouldn\'t even be taken seriously as a demote request.\\n\\nI have had problems with Brando before so I am not being biased, if anything I am breaking my comfort siding with him over 2 of the 3 people I actually really care about personally (Punk and Ben), but Derp wants to get Brando\'s admin taken away over absolutely nothing, just like he tried and so failed at with me, I am not gonna watch it happen to someone else.\\n\\nWith respect as an irl friend Derp, I said you would cause a problem as soon as you came back, and avoided coming back to ttt while you were on because I know how you bring the clan down into fighting and bullshit. I only came within last few days because I have I responsibility to the clan as an admin I take very seriously, and I enjoy playing with everyone. Is it not a coincidence that all this started after he came back? I thought they learned when they banned you for what they said was for good the last time (for 3rd time), but apparently not, because someone made the insane decision of letting you back despite my many warnings. And you have the nerve to tell Brando he doesn\'t deserve to be admin when you don\'t even deserve to be here.\\n\\nYou are one of my best friends and I love you, but it\'s like you take joy in bringing anyone above you down. As long as you are here that is what you will do.
