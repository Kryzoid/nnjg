William L. Fudge\\n3) Your SteamID: STEAM_0:1:26710649\\n4) When were you banned and for how long: 10/16/2011 around 3:30 a.m\\n5) Reason for ban: Traitor Bating/ trolling\\n6) Who banned you: udane\\n7) Why should we unban you or shorten your ban period: Because i did not traitor bait. I was behind udane and we were at a map where it had a vent and on allot of maps the vents are breakable, so i shot it to see if it was and i didn\'t hear the distinct noise it makes when something is breakable so i just kept walking and udane shot me in the back. Then Luigi killed udane for killing me which udane was already proven for killing a traitor, and when we were in dead chat udane said i know 3 people who are getting a slay next round, two being Luigi and i. So i said \\"A slay? for what?\\" and he said you right you don\'t deserve a slay you should get banned. Which i laughed a little to my self because i thought he was just messing with me, but next thing you know i get banned for a week, which he shortened to 3 day which still is to long for something so minor. The trolling wasn\'t really that bad either. It was the last round on the map homegrown, right before all this other stuff happened. It was Nuttbutter, wherethelove, and i. which i thought it was only us 3 left. Nutterbutter was proven so i just thought it was \\"wherethelove\\" so i said Nutterbutter and i are the last 2 traitors just messing around(that being the trolling part) and wherethelove said oh really? Then said yeah aren\'t we the last three? and he said no i saw another guy. So i couldn\'t kill him because no proof, so then nuttbutter gets sniped by someone, i forgot who, but i kill the guy who killed him and he was an innocent. Then another guy pops up (jellyfish) which it made since to me, that he should be the last traitor because \\"wherethelove\\" is not known for carrying a round out. so i start shooting jellyfish was his name and he starts shooting back, then where the love starts shooting me because earlier i said that nutter and i were the traitors which nutter wasn\'t a traitor either. So i start running and the round ends or jellyfish fail to death, i cant really remember what happened but i have a recording i can post of it if you need it. So that\'s all. Not really a 3 day ban"},{"postId":35487,"topicId":4509,"posterId":1109,"postTime":1318762409,"postText":"The homegrown thing was just a big cluster of confusion. i was in the game but not in the area for the \\"T baiting\\", so cant give an account on that. \\nThink 3 day ban is extreme for 1 case of T baiting.\\n(im Wherethelove)"},{"postId":35488,"topicId":4509,"posterId":605,"postTime":1318763137,"postText":"I\'ll pretty much reiterate everything I discussed directly to fudge in steamchat, for the sake of clarity.\\nHis ban was actually labled under (minor) rdm, minor trolling, tbaiting. This isnt the case showing up on the ban pages, it didn\'t edit properly. \\nThe ban length was first set at 1 week, as the sm_admin doesnt give precise time control, and i use sm_admin to make sure nothing is incorrectly copied from console.\\n\\nThe direct reason for each reason to add to the ban were as follows;\\nRdm: There were 3 players, fudge included. He knew one of the two alive as a regular, and as thus, knew this player to exhibit certain traits when they are a T. He used this information to then attack and kill the last player. Granted he was right, but he used circumstancial evidence. I honestly cant recall if fudge was the one who killed him or not, and as thus, and am unsure to lable it as minor or not.\\nMinor Trolling: Included in this situtation a case of self callout, and a few verbal comments.\\nTbaiting: From my perspective, the bullet wizzed right beside me from behind me, and I turned around to see you reloading, so I assumed you were attempting to hide the fact you were a T, and killed you. This is dependant on the demo you said you are going to show me, which will show the proper angling of your shot. If it turns out to be far enough away to not directly constitue tbaiting, I will chalk it up to insanely bad timing (as you say you were just trying to shoot vents) and apologize.\\n\\nNo one of these caused the ban by themselves, it mostly a joint operation, with the largest ban time coming from the tbaiting. Once I see the demo Fudge plans on uploading, I will decide if I should shorten/resolve the ban at that point. In addition, I\'m going to go ahead and leave the ban pages unchanged in the terms of reasoning untill a direct result has been decided on.\\n\\n(I\'d also just like to clarify on weegee, he shot towards me saying pew pew, I thought he was toying with me before he actually killed me, and shot him first.)\\n\\nEdit: Also, frokid, the early part of the situation is not really part of the matter, the only part that was as such was the direct rdm from believing he understood another player\'s psychology. This is circumstancial and as thus, not hard evidence."},{"postId":35520,"topicId":4509,"posterId":706,"postTime":1318795842,"postText":"Its not really rdm if you think you have enough proff to kill. Also no one killed him time ran out i think. Its in the demo but the playdemo command is still broken. The monor trolling i did. No one gave me anywarnings to stop nor did anyone complain directly to me endicating that it was getting on there nerves. So basicly i just got banned because i shot near udane at a vent. If i shot at the vent near anyone else i wouldnt be banned. So thats a little bit of admin abuse. You have to treat everyone the same even you."},{"postId":35533,"topicId":4509,"posterId":605,"postTime":1318801598,"postText":"In the case of rdm, it would be the same as if rainbolt followed me for a couple of minutes, and as thus I \\"knew\\" it wasn\'t him, because he likes to knife me. Using this \\"evidence\\" I\'d then proceed to kill you. The fact is, players could act different then they normally act to throw another player off, as such, you can\'t gather evidence based on what a player would normally do. Ergo, since there was no form of hard evidence, it would not be rdm.\\nMinor trolling is just that, minor, and as thus, played an extremely small part in the ban length, around 12 hours. Though I did complain once about it, I assume I was drowned out and you didnt hear it.\\nIf anyone showed me what I saw if they were the person who was being shot at, you would have been banned. Again, not for the tbaiting itself, but for a conjoint reason of all of the above mentioned.\\n\\nAlso, I believe you are unaware of the times I\'d slay myself for even accidental rdm in the cases where I would shoot someone without a legit reason... ie, turn a corner and fire one bullet being startled. I usualy suicide that round so as to not make them lose karma, then slay myself the next round as well... If I believed I was not the same as anyone else, I would blaim the other dude, and keep on walking as if nothing happened."},{"postId":35541,"topicId":4509,"posterId":706,"postTime":1318805832,"postText":"I always usually punish my self if i accidentally rdm. Even when i didnt think i rdmed i still slayed myself. That\'s me punishing myself, not you punishing me. So that punishment was for rdming/trolling. So again i was only banned for the tbaiting, which in your preference i did. Again i would have slayed myself just because you thought my attention was to tbait you. So 3 days for one tbait, still overly punished, 1 hour would have been to much also. It should have been a slay which i would have done myself."},{"postId":35543,"topicId":4509,"posterId":605,"postTime":1318806980,"postText":"It is not in your position to punish yourself.\\n\\nEdit: Due to the fact you want to keep attempting to only justify the ban as the tbait and the tbait alone, this topic will be locked, as it\'s getting nowhere."}]}')}}]);
