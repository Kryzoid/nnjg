I know the purpose of the knife is supposed to be a quick kill and the drawback is the MASSIVE DNA time.\\n2. It also helps new players get acustomed to playing better.\\n\\nbut\\nI think its rather rediculous if i get teamed up on by four traitors, i kill three of them, and the fourth clicks on me.\\nso heres my proposal.\\n\\nWe should have the knife changed.\\nthere is a poll at the top that has a few suggestions so that the knife is less OP.\\n\\nPoll features: you can change your vote, you can only vote once. poll ends in 7 days."},{"postId":33806,"topicId":4246,"posterId":1094,"postTime":1316496284,"postText":"I really can\'t decide, but one thing I do feel is that if the knife was changed so only throw one-hit, people would just get point blank and throw more often, so it wouldn\'t really change anything. Unless lag/lag-compensation made it miss, in which case it would just cause more anger as a traitor is robbed of a kill.\\n\\nAlso, the 99 damage has two flaws I can see: \\n1. It will lead to people attacking first in obvious ways, alerting the victim before the kill.  The purpose of the knife is to be a silent, quick kill. The only way to really do it stealthily with this change would be to crowbar them first, which would give a player with fast reaction times enough warning to ruin the knife.\\n\\n2.  Health upgrades will lead to the knife leaving someone with health left and giving them an opportunity to murder their would-be assassin.  Admittedly it would be nice to fight back, but the knife\'s purpose is to kill the person in one hit, before they see it coming, guaranteed.\\n\\nJust my opinions, I\'m not hating."},{"postId":33808,"topicId":4246,"posterId":612,"postTime":1316500498,"postText":"All im saying is, how hard is it to click once."},{"postId":33895,"topicId":4246,"posterId":292,"postTime":1316558464,"postText":"Regardless of how annoying it is to be knifed by a person you know you could kill in a gun fight, they are traitors and they are outnumbered and for some people the knife is the ONLY way to get a kill.
