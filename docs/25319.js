I have seen him, on multiple occasions bypass this Anti-cheat through some means to Re-Spawn Himself, Teleport, and Change Character Models.\\n1 - Storm was accused of Rdming someone who used the Teleport, so the Round after I slayed Him, only to find him alive later.  He said he Re-Spawned himself because he disagreed for being slayed because he \\"Used Logic\\".  He also gave me a code which he said he used to Re-spawn himself *player.GetByID(3):SpawnForRound()*.  Now, Re-spawning yourself is Major Abuse, It is using your powers, That only Super Admins should have, to give yourself an advantage.  Now, He Re-Spawned himself because he didn\'t Agree with my Slay, Showing he is Willing to use his Powers to Bypass Admin/Mod\'s Decisions. This is Clear Major Abuse.\\n2 - He has also shown the ability to Teleport, while he only did so once because he was Stuck, but still he bypassed the Anti-Cheat to obtain Admin powers as V.I.P.  He should only have and use Gag, ungag, and votekick.\\n3 - He can also change the character model of not only himself but to others and I do have screenshots of this and so does Balenti.\\nIt doesn\'t matter if it\'s funny or not, the only person who should be able to do as he Damn Well Pleases is Gash as he does own the server.\\n4 - While I\'ve only Seen him Re-Spawn/Teleport/Change Models, It\'s safe to assume that he has other \\"powers\\" and is not afraid to use them\\nI don\'t really care If he is Perma-Banned or If Gash makes it clear he is not to do it again or makes it so he can\'t, I just want some action taken.  \\nP.S. DO NOT POST \\"HE TROLLS TOO* THIS IS ONLY ABOUT HIS ABUSE, NOTHING ELSE post that on Crisis\'s Thread"},{"postId":22621,"topicId":2811,"posterId":115,"postTime":1306203180,"postText":"As much as I value all of your opinions on this matter, I have already stated it is being dealt with by the administrative team in an admin only section of the forums."}]}')}}]);
