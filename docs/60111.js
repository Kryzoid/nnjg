It was a default day on Hellz_Prison so I go up to the back wall. I like to be a rebellious prisoner and Etrius was a guard. I begin punching letters into the wall. I start with \\"Etrius is...\\" and finish off with \\"fat.\\" A few seconds later I\'m banned for disrespect. I don\'t think it was necessary to ban me. Can I get an unban?\\n\\nL2laughalittlebit."},{"postId":38176,"topicId":4949,"posterId":812,"postTime":1321823492,"postText":"Please use this format:\\n    1) Which server:\\n    2) Your in-game name:\\n    3) Your SteamID:\\n    4) When were you banned and for how long:\\n    5) Reason for ban:\\n    6) Who banned you:\\n    7) Why should we unban you or shorten your ban period:"},{"postId":38181,"topicId":4949,"posterId":1205,"postTime":1321824714,"postText":"Fixed."}]}')}}]);
