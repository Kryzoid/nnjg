Its unfair and annoying because if one person has a disguise kit and they kill just 1 guard then the prisoners get the gun the guard dropped and then its like dominoes, 1 by 1 the prisoners kill a guard and take the gun until they are all dead before the guards even got to play a game. i think the chance of getting a disguise kit should be lowered so its not so easy to kill the guards."},{"postId":16190,"topicId":1952,"posterId":377,"postTime":1298226198,"postText":"So you wanna make the Prisoners job THAT much harder, and basically make the game a cake walk for the Guards?"},{"postId":16192,"topicId":1952,"posterId":112,"postTime":1298226906,"postText":"Its pretty low, but the chances of at least 1/18 people having it is good.

Two disguised prisoners is not uncommon each round, and that makes it next to impossible for the guards to win. It is way to hard for the guards to control the prisoners, and that is the whole point of the server, not a round after round massacre of the guards.  This problem is far less prominent when playing with lower numbers of people, but some serious re-balancing needs to be done when more players are on."},{"postId":17357,"topicId":1952,"posterId":372,"postTime":1300221914,"postText":"So I just played a round with six people, four of them prisoners, and of those four three of the prisoners were disguised.
