Lol I played it before it came to Steam, but when they did release it, I was surprised how many other people played it. I totally agree that it is archaic compared to newer ones, but it is a solid game, and 2 big reasons I played it until recently. First, my desktop sucks hard, it\'s like 6=7 years old, even with all the tuning and new parts I get it, it\'s weak. It can\'t handle the newer more awesome games, so RS was a good alternative. Second, price. WoW is great, but with RS is about 3 or 4 times cheaper, not even including the fact that you have to spend like $40 to buy game, and however much for extras lol."},{"postId":5120,"topicId":434,"posterId":2,"postTime":1281132075,"postText":"Connect to that persons network\\nStart bar\\nSearch\\nCmd\\n\\ntype in the following\\n\\n\\"net user\\"\\n\\n\\"net view\\"\\n\\n\\"tracert <the guys computer name>\\"\\n\\n\\"shutdown -i\\"\\n\\nFor the name, put their ip.\\n\\nlawl."},{"postId":5121,"topicId":434,"posterId":84,"postTime":1281134247,"postText":"You fiend Gash ;D"},{"postId":5134,"topicId":434,"posterId":13,"postTime":1281157578,"postText":"I\'m actually gonna try that ;P, probably on Crazy Monkey\'s computer first though.
