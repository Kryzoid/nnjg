Maybe 2 copies, if I feel like it.\\n\\n Rules \\n\\nMake ONE post picking a number from 1 to 100. This way all 540 plus members have a shot. Use \\"Ctrl F\\" to make sure no one has your number. Try not to pick a number that someone has already picked, because the first person who picked that number will win.\\n\\nDo not edit posts. Any one number you pick is your final number. Feel free to add some text as long as its not long and your Number is the first thing... as well... there should only be one number per post.\\n\\nI will be gifting the game to you through steam. So you will need to add me to your friend list. Note that the contest will end Sunday or maybe even Monday. If the contest dose end Sunday, you still won\'t get it till Monday... Unless I give it to you Sunday. Just to be safe... make all posts before Sunday noon.\\n\\nI will send you a Private massage through NNJG PM system... Only after you have gotten the game will I anounce your victory over eveyone else.\\n\\nThis is for people who do not have Portal 2 already... If you already have Portal 2, then this is not a contest for you.\\n\\n Words of Inspiration \\n\\nI hope you all win,\\n\\nbut only one of you will.\\n\\nDon\'t forget that.\\n\\nSide note... I have moved it from 1-666 to 1-100.
