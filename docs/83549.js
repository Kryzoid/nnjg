On lap 11, a 15-car pileup crash took place, with several cars getting airborne, in this crash, Dan Wheldon lost his life. He was 33, he was married, and had two very young children. Wheldon won the Indy 500 earlier this year, and was racing for a possible 5 million dollars if he would have won the race. Dan was described as a great driver, and an even better person. I don\'t follow the IndyCar series too often, but when I do watch it, I usually cheered for Dan. After the crash, the race was delayed for several hours, but once the news broke that Wheldon passed away, the race was canceled. It was supposed to be a glorious finale to the IndyCar season, but it turned into one of the darkest days in IndyCar history. A 5-Lap slow-paced memorial was held. Dan Wheldon loved racing, and he passed away doing what he loved. R.I.P.
