Yet hands dont kill anyone (minus yourself from missuse), ergo, classification has nothing to do with lethal force.\\n\\nI would also like to clarify while im here. Explosive barrels being launched by a T with this weapon and then shoot it to kill players are fine. But if all they do is launch it and hope it explodes on it\'s way down, then it\'s against the rules. The reasoning is if you shoot a barrel, it shows you shot it in damagelogs. Otherwise it just usualy comes up as suicide.
