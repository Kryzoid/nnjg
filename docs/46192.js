I forget what model it is and peeled off the sticker that said, but here are specs:\\nWindows 7 64bit OS\\n6 GB RAM\\nIntel i5 Processor (Quadcore, 2.3ghz each)\\nGraphics Card nonexistant (from what I\'ve been told it allocates RAM to graphics, all it says is \\"Intel HD Graphics Family\\" where it should say my type of card)\\nIt\'s not a powerhouse, but it runs most of my games fine (has trouble with BFBC2, but on a 32man server things get out of control so it makes sense)\\nI don\'t need it to run on the highest settings, but I would like to be able to play without it look like shit or having lots of framerate stutter.\\nObviously it\'s hard to tell without using my computer, but just an estimate as to whether or not it will work fine would be appreciated.  I don\'t want to spend $60 then discover it\'s basically unplayable.\\nThanks for reading, hope this isn\'t spam box material."},{"postId":37676,"topicId":4873,"posterId":4,"postTime":1320992148,"postText":"If the topic you want to post actually has reasoning for posting it (i.e, discussing a video game, asking a question, making fun of a food) then it belongs in off-topic.\\nIf you just want to post a picture that says LOL FUNNYRAFF IS A SQUIRREL STICKING OUT OF LOLICONVICT\'S ASS, and you WANT your thread to get derailed, then it belongs in the spam box.

I\'m going through this article  on how to do it, but I\'m not sure if opening up my laptop is something I want to do.  Does anyone know if there would be a store that would provide services like that?
