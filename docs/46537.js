I find that Arkham City is much better than the previous one, But I will be rating both individually.\\n\\nFirst off the bat is Arkham Asylum.\\nYou play as the world\'s Greatest Detective Batman, aka Bruce Wayne. In this game you face the likes of Killer Crock, Bane, and you run into Harley Quinn also but isn\'t a boss wave. There are also side mission called Riddlers Challenges which causes you to think except for one, eventually Riddler gets mad and tells you what you are looking for. In this version you can also play wave survivals, and pick off enemies by yourself. Unfortunately this game does not have co-op (nor does Arkham City). This also comes with a pair of 3D glasses that you can play on any 2d TV with (it reccomends a HD TV to do so). I also have to say that this looks amazing even though you are using the Classic Red and Blue 3D glasses but you do not lose color from the lens. I would have to say I am giving it a 3.5 out of 5. Due to almost no replay value on it and Good fighting Mechanics.\\n\\nNow for Arkham City.\\nTwo words: OPEN WORLD! This has to be one of my favorite open world game with a sightly large map and has numerous side missions to keep you occupied for hours and of course it has Riddler\'s Challenges that you can find around the map, some of which will make you say \\"Duh\\". Now as I stated before in this game you can play 3D on a 2D HD TV and no loss in color. You will come in counters with the likes of Quinn Harvey, Two Face, Penguin, and Mr. Freeze, just to name a few. This into consideration I give this one a 5 out of 5 due to a high replay value, and better fighting mechanics. Also if you buy this new you will receive a beta code for Arkham Imposters, and the Cat Woman bundle pack (can some one say TITTIES)"},{"postId":37502,"topicId":4839,"posterId":464,"postTime":1320728271,"postText":">>  (can some one say TITTIES)â€‰\\nTitties.\\nYou\'re welcome."}]}')}}]);
