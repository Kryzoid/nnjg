And they all must race to wall, last one there dies, and just keep on going until there\'s 1 left, tranq anyone who gets an early start\\n\\n * what\'s for dinner , line them up on a wall, go down line saying \\"what\'s for dinner?\\" if you like it they live if you don\'t like it they die\\n\\n * how\'d you get in prison , line them up on a wall, go down line saying \\"how\'d you get in prison?\\" there\'s some variations... But if they repeat what someone else said they die and if they got here for a really nasty reason they die... I\'m not too sure on exact rules I\'ve only witnessed it played never tried it much myself\\n\\n * tower of power , must have a lot of veteran prisoners with low gravity, but you have them line up against back wall (mars) and first one to touch the ceiling gets to decide what everyone does for the day, they have to jump on each others heads and work together\\n\\n * shower day,  (mars) have them all go to shower, once they\'re \\"clean\\" (aka stop rebelling and punching vent and drop all guns cause dumbass guards like to run into showers and get mauled to death) have them line up against shower tunnel glass wall and have them play last reaction or something just like any other day\\n\\n * simon says , line em up against a wall, say you\'re simon and make them do various commands if they don\'t they die, you can try combining commands by having them punch the wall while jumping and then say crouch and it\'ll mess a ton of people up... One game I played with swaim I remember I had them jump crouching while punching their neighbors was pretty amusing\\n\\n *relay race , when 2 prisioners are left, have them touch a button, another button, then make it back to where they started\\n\\n * all prisioners to infirmiry / safe room (isolation) no detours no delays,  (another one for mars) a lot of them die because of the doors... And then usually there\'s a rebellion that happens it\'s really amusing, but if all goes well tell them to go back to the wall and start the day like normal\\n\\n * drawing day , have them line up on a blank wall and tell them whoever makes the prettiest picture gets to decide what we do (most of the people draw dicks lmao)\\n\\n\\nI could go on and on i\'m gonna stop here >.>"},{"postId":14862,"topicId":1752,"posterId":142,"postTime":1296010618,"postText":"Speaking of which, Bird when you gonna make people download the lego map :D"},{"postId":14864,"topicId":1752,"posterId":366,"postTime":1296011205,"postText":">> Speaking of which, Bird when you gonna make people download the lego map :D seriously Bird do this, lego is great.\\n\\nEdit: I love you bird"},{"postId":14867,"topicId":1752,"posterId":481,"postTime":1296012708,"postText":"Thanks for the newgames im going to have fun with them tomarrow."},{"postId":14870,"topicId":1752,"posterId":3,"postTime":1296015081,"postText":">> Speaking of which, Bird when you gonna make people download the lego map :D \\nA majority of our loyal jail players have it downloaded.
