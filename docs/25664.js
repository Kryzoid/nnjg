I know it is in ttt but i thought it might be different here...\\n\\nHoling up these questions for a while now. \\n\\n\\n1. I think they are. Reason: Guards camp and shoot at any/all prisoners they see. Prevents people crying over freekill\\n2. Um, no.\\n3. Yes it is against the rules. I say this whenever I join Jail because retards say \\"Stay in ur cell or b3 shawt\\" \\n4. Yes. It\'s not required to have a mic to be warden, but it is recommended. If you\'re asking about other guards saying \\"Last reactions crouch\\" while the warden is saying \\"Simon says jump\\"  Then yes, it is. Unless the Warden is dead no one else can give orders.\\n5. Not too sure, but I\'d be pretty mad too if someone said \\"He has a gun/knife!1!!1!!! s0 can i haz tranq 4 r3wurd?\\"\\n6. I\'m not too sure about this one, but I think it\'d be better to just allow them to be kicked by the AFK kicker. But that\'s just me"},{"postId":21244,"topicId":2652,"posterId":112,"postTime":1304903414,"postText":">> 1. Are wardays/ddays banned? If so, why?\\n2. Are vips allowed to slap eachother?

I know it is in ttt but i thought it might be different here...\\n\\nHoling up these questions for a while now. \\n\\n1 Yes\\n2 If a VIP was breaking the rules then yes they can be slapped, just like anybody else.\\n3 You can make them stay in their cells, but the doors have to be open.\\n4 Yes\\n5 Its not against the rules, it\'s a way to earn some browning points with the guards. (Even though it\'s a dick move)\\n6 You only kill the afks if them being afk is disobeying your order. Ex: If you told everybody to get to the back wall then you could kill the afk, but you probably wouldn\'t kill him if you were having a pool day"},{"postId":21245,"topicId":2652,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304903773,"postText":"Ok thanks faro\\n\\nI wasnt breaking any rules, but uiik rageslapped me for killing him when he was the last person to get to the sauna on last reaction"},{"postId":21253,"topicId":2652,"posterId":692,"postTime":1304906410,"postText":"k."},{"postId":21269,"topicId":2652,"posterId":740,"postTime":1304918271,"postText":"Hahahaha. :3 when hemad heslap? :D"},{"postId":21281,"topicId":2652,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304936237,"postText":"Apparently.
