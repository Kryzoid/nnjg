And Gash wants a person to earn a command like this and not buy it. At Destar\'s idea, quite possible but income of VIPS coming in after 3 months will be ridiculous. It should be that a VIP directly ask Gash through steam or PM and if Gash deems that person able to control the command and not abuse then they will get it."},{"postId":26392,"topicId":3331,"posterId":397,"postTime":1311733633,"postText":"we have discussed something like this earlier, what bewm said is kinda what happened"},{"postId":26394,"topicId":3331,"posterId":112,"postTime":1311734250,"postText":"I just have one main question.\\n\\nIf you can\'t get the server to votekick them, why do you think you can get the server to voteslay them?"},{"postId":26401,"topicId":3331,"posterId":252,"postTime":1311735814,"postText":">> I just have one main question.\\n\\nIf you can\'t get the server to votekick them, why do you think you can get the server to voteslay them? \\nThis.\\n\\nAnd do you think the majority of the players actually read what the vote is for?"},{"postId":26404,"topicId":3331,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311736779,"postText":"2 things:\\n\\n1) As already said, this will get denied instantly since it\'s been brought up several times and was already removed once from abuse.\\n\\n2) How can we trust a VIP to voteslay correctly when they don\'t even use the gag command properly."},{"postId":26408,"topicId":3331,"posterId":612,"postTime":1311737521,"postText":"Votekick and vote slay are two different things\\nabuse reports will stop abuse.\\nand then let vips have the power to slay.\\n\\nit should be used only when needed.\\nand i think you should have the Vet VIPS because its a necessary command to let vips have. votekick isnt the same as a slay"},{"postId":26413,"topicId":3331,"posterId":769,"postTime":1311738370,"postText":"I think something reasonable to add would be a reason for votekicking.
