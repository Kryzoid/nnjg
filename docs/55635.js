Fun, right?\\n\\nAlthough we have no had so much luck in the past with our old PERP server (abusive admins/coders, hackers, you know what I\'m talking about) it was still extremely popular and will surely suceed.\\n\\nThe owner of the server is Alec Itzaina. He owned the NNJG Darkrp server before it was shut down. The head coder is none other than Storm. He has done a good job so far and has much experience with PERP coding. \\n\\nLater on, we will post the link to the gamemode and the map for you to download. But for now, we are still working on it, and more modifications are being made.\\n\\nThis will surely become a great addition to the NNJG servers, and should create some great publicity and renevue. \\n\\nAny questions, feel free to ask!"},{"postId":21477,"topicId":2666,"posterId":521,"postTime":1305060522,"postText":"Question: Is there some sort of perp tutorial out there"},{"postId":21485,"topicId":2666,"posterId":115,"postTime":1305064014,"postText":">> Question: Is there some sort of perp tutorial out there \\n\\nThere\'s plenty of videos with the gamemode in it.
