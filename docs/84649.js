A tail fin and a dorsal above the water.i scream like a fucking girl. freeze in my path,then the fucking fin goes underwater and I almost shit myself(the whole time waves are comeing in and they feel like fucking water thrashing around me),so I stay where I am for about 12 seconds in neck high water bouncing with waves and then I see a large wave comeing and say to the girls not to move and wait for the wave to body surf it in,so we wait for an additional 8 seconds then fucking jump with the wave and surf it in till about 20 feet from shore, only to be greeted by the faggot ass lifegaurd who is chilling in knee high water telling us to hurry in and that he saw a shark near us.
