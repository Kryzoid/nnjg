I don\'t have a camera to take pictures of the art I do. I can easily do stuff like it though, I just searched \\"hope graffiti\\" and found it. Hope is my tag name. I tag \\"hope\\" because it restores some hope in me, cause I lost most of my hope in the world, so I just tag hope because I\'m good at it, and it restores some of that lost hope. But yeah, I just found this and it looked like something I could do."}]}')}}]);
