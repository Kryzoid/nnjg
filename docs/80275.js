I think the more important thing than me being promoted is demotions.  Demotions have to occur eventually, and unfortunately, I have to recommend a large portion our Jailbreak staff for demotion.    From what I can tell, Pharaoh, Quack, Joster, Balenti, Kobooold, BoomShaka, and Kush are all extremely inactive, to the point that no one has heard of their names, not even in whispers.  There really needs to be room for people to move up the ladder, and if the people at the top of the ladder are keeping others from progressing, then we need to get rid of them.  I would really like to become a super admin, but if it these inactive staff members is what is keeping me from moving up, something needs to change."},{"postId":31895,"topicId":3946,"posterId":115,"postTime":1315024324,"postText":"Josters no longer a mod, not sure with balenti, pharaoh and myself are globals, Kob idk, kush has been on vacation, bewm idk"},{"postId":31899,"topicId":3946,"posterId":735,"postTime":1315025617,"postText":"Last time I have seen them\\nBalenti- 3 weeks ago\\nKobooold- like a month ago for like 5 minutes.\\nBoomShaka-1 1/2 weeks ago\\nKush-I don\'t even remember him"},{"postId":31905,"topicId":3946,"posterId":142,"postTime":1315026419,"postText":"I hop onto jail from time to time yet with college on my head, TTT and free time for myself, I try to balance it out.
