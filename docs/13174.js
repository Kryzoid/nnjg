It toke us almost half an hour for a four man team to all get into the same game. And then, it toke another one to get are mic\'s working. \\n\\nThanks to peram, we where able to get all are mic\'s working with his awsome idea.\\n\\n Combat \\n\\nIs pretty good overal I say. One thing I have noticed was, useing sharp/blade objects kills of the standared zombie (walkers). While blunt weapons knock down newly infected quickly (Infected/I just call them runners)\\n\\nCars are OP and Knives UP, the only thing keeps knives from being useless is that they only bend (AKA Never break, but onec they reach that point you may aswell punch the zombie to death.)\\n\\nThere are a lot of weapons. And not just random stuff you find on the ground. If you talk A/THE (Not sure if there are more) shop owner. You can buy some pretty sick shit from him/them. (If there is more them one)\\n\\nIf you have already played it, put in your two cents on the game.\\n\\nBut, overall, I recommend getting the game. Note: I haven\'t seen the game get updated, but with the gliches it has going on, I\'m sure it will happen something soon."},{"postId":32387,"topicId":4019,"posterId":612,"postTime":1315332030,"postText":"Holy shit.

If the mini-map was like, oh she\'s over here, then that\'d be fine. No, they just expect you to randomly find the things or people you need to complte quests entirely on your own."},{"postId":32642,"topicId":4019,"posterId":1003,"postTime":1315450443,"postText":"I like this game a lot now that they fixed most of the bugs I had.

If their is no mark for it, it is either a dumb ass mistake to miss or they want it to be a small challenge. I am currently on Act 3 and i love the game to its entirety. The combat system is awesome, game is a challenge and almost forces you to play with others. Only thing that i personally dislike is the driving. But that is just because the FOV is really small. Even in a damn car you get more FOV then the game gives you. But overall the game has little bugs since they removed the Dev version and with Hamachi i have no issues playing with friends. \\n\\nIf your really having THAT much issue doing a quest, tell me which quest/chapter it is and I can tell you what to do. Half the fun in the game is exploring as well. Drove my car off a mountain and that was one of the most enjoyable things for me. The Easter Eggs in the game are awesome as well. (You will have to figure these out yourself like I did) So far I have completed 4 of the Easter Eggs and they are all awesome."},{"postId":35644,"topicId":4019,"posterId":1016,"postTime":1318907615,"postText":"Worse thing was is that I got this and Deus Ex at the same time, played and loved DE:HR to the point I couldn\'t get into Dead Island, might do it some time."}]}')}}]);
