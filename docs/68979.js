Also, when documenting someone RDM\'ing and leaving, the best is to allow the damage logs not take up all console, especially when it\'s that early in the game, and try to have him leaving included in that screenshot so it\'s evident that left right away.\\n\\nAnother thing is you need to stop jumping to conclusions and such. You do this way to often, as you said in that screenshot almost immediately \\"WOW TACO FUCK YOU\\". Even though you were right, the best thing to do is wait till the end of the round for logs and then deal with it. Flaming him gets you no where.\\n\\nAnyway, banned for a day. Locked."}]}')}}]);
