Yes, you have to buy characters with the money you earn in game after each match. \\n\\nThere are two kinds of levels in this game. Champion (Heroes we get) Levels, and Summoner Level.\\n\\nChampion level is the level of your Hero/Champion in every new match and in every new match its start at level 1. Levels range from 1 to 18. Every 6th level is ultimate availablity)\\n\\nSummoner Level is the level of your overall player, you get experience and IP (in game currency) after every match (unless you leave).
