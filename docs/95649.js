If it\'s for temporary use, do a slay instead. For example, if someone is trolling/etc and freekilled the entire team, it\'s your choice to either blacklist or ban the person. Do other people want him around even as a prisoner? Would he cause problems as a prisoner? If you answered no to the first and yes to the second, just ban the person. If you answered the other way around, then blacklist. It\'s just for those situations where the person should still be allowed on the server but only causes trouble as a guard."},{"postId":22758,"topicId":2826,"posterId":373,"postTime":1306359268,"postText":"Alright thanks, that really helped :D"}]}')}}]);
