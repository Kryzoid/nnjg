I will be using - and + for negative and positive notes about the selected map. I\'ll use a ? to mark a nuetral comment.\\nAlso, both maps are fullbright, this is a serious no no. Be sure to place a light_environment into the map, otherwise, light/light_spot/etc wont work.\\n\\nttt_maze;\\n-teleporters are kinda hard to notice, since they are the same material as everything else, and the same shape as the gun spawn blocks\\n-no real definite location for players to head towards, except to the top of the maze, which then becomes too open\\n-repeating textures (just about 3 textures, thats all in this map), and two cases where no textures were even used\\n-not enough guns for 22 players (the max server size)\\nOverall, I can\'t recommend this map, even if it was polished... it feels like a map that was made to learn how to map, not an actual map.\\n\\nttt_lila;\\n+There is potential floating around\\n+Good areas for both close combat and mid range combat\\n?The car props are static, meaning they dont move, meaning magneto rod wont slaughter everyone\\n?Halflife2 ep2 textures tend to annoy players if included into maps (at least i think thats what those windows are)\\n-Too small for 22 players, I suggest adding another underground like area on the opposite side of the other one around half the size of the first one.\\n-Not enough guns for 22 players, simple fix by adding more guns.\\n-Could use a few extra textures in the lower area to add diveristy\\n-If an inno knows of the secret teleport to the roof, and use the teleport to the hidden room, but a T doesnt know of it... the round will time out in one long wait... i suggest adding a trigger_hurt in there doing 3 damage a second ish.\\nOverall, some tweaking, some editing, and a bit of love may be required to have this map make it somewhere :o"}]}')}}]);
