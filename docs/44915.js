He says he wasn\'t ever on the roof but from my point of view it looked like he was. I did say sorry to him after wards because of what looked like rdm. Overall from my point of view it looked like he came from roof with a unidentified body and i killed him for that. He didn\'t ask me to slay myself or anything so i figured he didn\'t mind too much, i would have slayed myself if he had asked since i know it looked like a rdm even though i had a good reason.\\n\\nEDIT: I was their for ammo check, but you CAN NOT kill on ammo checks.
