Alarms are thrown against the wall with primary mouse button and stick there. They act like a ranger, emitting a beam across a space, with a maxrange of, 100 maybe. When a prisoner comes across one, it emits a loud noise, alerting all the guards. I think the guards need some buffing because all the prisoners seem to be able to sneak by without the guards noticing... These could be placed in vents, etc.\\n\\nI can\'t seem to find any alarm sweps in gmod.org, but i bet someone could mod a tripmine or SLAM to delete the explosion function and add a sound emitter function."},{"postId":17977,"topicId":2226,"posterId":438,"postTime":1301292108,"postText":"You mean like when you\'re an IRIS in the Hidden : Source game and you get them alarm things?
