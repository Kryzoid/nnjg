Every day I play on the Jail Break server, I have to make another one. I\'m sick of having to put up with people breaking rules all the damn time and having nobody there to get rid of them. Sometimes I am unable to get good proof, so they get away with it.\\n\\nI\'d like to ask why there is such a lack of people moderating the server. Is it because there aren\'t enough admins for every server? Then recruit more. Is it because of time zone problems? Then recruit more people from different time zones. Is it because the admins just don\'t like playing jailbreak? Then recruit someone who does.\\n\\nThere\'s a reason none of my ban requests follow the format, and that\'s because I couldn\'t care less about it. I\'m already having to go out of my own way to get proof, organize it, and post it here. Why you people think I would bother with something as petty as presentation I don\'t know, because this isn\'t my job and I\'m not trying to sell things to you.\\n[/rant]"},{"postId":19028,"topicId":2379,"posterId":521,"postTime":1302911650,"postText":"if you dont format cuz yer lazy we dont listen cuz wer lazy\\n\\nSEE WHAT I DID THERE?"},{"postId":19030,"topicId":2379,"posterId":142,"postTime":1302912691,"postText":"Now calm down right thurrr.
