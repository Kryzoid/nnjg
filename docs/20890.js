The windows 7 disk is taking about 4 hours to start up so that alone should take a few days, also I\'ve been going out a lot recently and next week I am going to be at fencing and gymnastics so I won\'t be on much Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday until December and January then it will be over around April and then I am going to the school dance on Friday, recently Garry\'s Mod has been kinda boring so I will be taking a break.
