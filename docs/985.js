With the possibility of lightly damaging nearby players.\\n\\n(and when i stated 1 shot, i meant, 1 bullet, not 1 shot kill) \\nMaybe 50 damage on first shot, and dealing 20 damage in bursts every 2 seconds afterwards for 10 seconds?"},{"postId":35399,"topicId":4490,"posterId":82,"postTime":1318565698,"postText":"By no means am I intending to troll here but this will likely turn out pretty bad based on the suggestions coming from this thread. A single target damage over time weapon serves no purpose at all to traitors, it is just a chance for innocents to call them out.\\n\\nI would support it if\\n1. It creates arcs of lightning between players, no more than 50-75ish source units\\n2. The furthest player being damaged exponentially more than original target and others, forcing traitors to think about their targets\\n3. It will damage the players as long as they are close together, forcing targets to scramble while taking damage and becoming easy pickings for the traitors\\n4. It will cause damage for about 15 seconds, during which, the last person in the chain will be damaged over that time for 300 health (until he dies, or the link to him is broken, then the damage will go to the next furthest person connected in the arc) and the rest of the players will be dealt a maximum of 100 over 15 seconds\\n5. It does not replace betrayal, betrayal is balanced as far as I am concerned\\n\\nElectrocution can be handled via two ways\\n http://i.imgur.com/RX481.png  \\nClick image if it is cut off (or this) \\n\\nIt is balanced because it is only has a 100% kill rate if the innocents decide they want to die and not move. However one negative to this is that players can cause other players to be hurt or killed, both intentionally and not."},{"postId":35402,"topicId":4490,"posterId":605,"postTime":1318579797,"postText":"I like model B that you mention, I do not like the amount of time/damage being shelled out. 15 seconds is a long time, making it extremely easy for players to scatter and break the attack in open areas. While in cramped areas, the most I\'d see players getting stuck is around 7 seconds... it would be better off to buy a jihad.\\nAlso, if I am not mistaken, doesn\'t electricty cause less damage the further it travels, thus dealing more damage to the closer player? (I am no longer certain if this is the case, ergo, it is a genuine question)\\nEither way, I like where this thread is going, and I believe this would just require some actual balancing before becoming a feasble idea, the real problem would be coding this weapon and forcing gash to accept it ;p"},{"postId":35486,"topicId":4490,"posterId":1081,"postTime":1318759603,"postText":"yes i agree with udane and the swarm connection for dominetto its like with the swarm connection they are within a few footsteps creating surges between them which would damage them until the spread out like on a carpet and sending the current through the carper therfore damageing the innocents but beware of the splash that this causes if the innocents hurt run to traitor buddys and the time is to much i get stuck alot in crowded areas and usually a jihad does the work and kills them all in about 3-4 seconds but 15 seconds is to much maybe 10 would be the plausable ammount and the damage is to much i mean more then a sniper headshot thats just downright overkill i say about 100 damage enough to get full well-prepared players down to badly wounded (those with 136 health full upgrade) which could make easy pickings for those good players that are such a hassle therfore making it easier to kill the harder players if they are new or not."},{"postId":35568,"topicId":4490,"posterId":1099,"postTime":1318818825,"postText":"I like all of the ideas. We should keep it to 5-10 seconds, anything more and that would be too long and traitor would become too obvious. I wouldn\'t mind this replacing the betrayal. It would be really cool if there was a setting on the device or pistol to determine how many targets there are and it would just end up as a hit or miss. Accuracy has to be a must."}]}')}}]);
