Everytime I join almost I end up getting pissed.  Just today I got Rdmed 8 times in a row by same trap, only twice was it traitor, I told everybody \\"ACTIVATE TRAP AS INNOCENT IS RDM\\" but they still do it.  It\'\' just things like this that make me hesitate to Join, I haven\'t been on for near 2 weeks cause of a bad round, and this time i think it will be different, it wasn\'t.  Not only that I\'m really pissed at how everything i do is watched and how everyone wants my Mod removed just So they can have it themselves (jt).  SO I slap a guy once in a while just like the other mods do... even the admins abuse, ALOT worse then I do.  Teleporting people into walls, spawning everything from Jihads to Antlion Guards, but they are all fine, but when i slap a guy ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  I can\'t even have an upside down name but Russian and Japanese names are alright.  It\'s just to the point where I am loosing the fun I had when I joined.  I\'m Not saying I\'m leaving, If anything i might just need a break since im already under a lot of pressure from things like Graduation, to Me might not being able to afford college and losing the ability to pursue my dream job, to my Mother Dieing and me having to take care of the house and my Old, Sick Father, who might die and leave me alone in this world.  I join a game to ease the stress of all this and ttt, what was my most favorite game in the world, to a group of asshats who do nothing but intensionally piss people off.  I\'m Not saying im leaving just yet, or quitting moderator, in fact without moderator there\'d be no way I could handle these Pricks.  I\'m just saying I might not be on as much cause I don\'t need stress.  I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME AND NNJG, I just don\'t know if i can\'t handle the poeple.  I miss Domeneeto, he was my role model as a Moderator, and he really fun, but the new guys, I don\'t think they even like me and just want me gone.  It\'s really depressing... Well thats what i got to say,  wow this really looks like an Emo rant 0_o."},{"postId":19760,"topicId":2471,"posterId":377,"postTime":1303885440,"postText":"Btw I expect no one to read this... and before u ask, no I\'m not making any of it up, My Mom\'s Dead, my Fathers Dying, I\'m Alone here, and my future is looking Grim.

I wanted to talk about a lot here, so the post decided I had too many quotes, and forced me to use \\"\\" instead.\\n\\n \\"Everytime I join almost I end up getting pissed....It\'s just to the point where I amloosing the fun I had when I joined\\" \\n\\nI sometimes question if I really picked the right server to map on... if i\'m not just wasting my time making something people will ignore and be too busy with the state of the server/only playing popular maps... the key, i\'ve found, is watching the server untill the right people you know are online, and ignoring it otherwise... There have been a few magical moments i\'ve had, and it\'s for those moments that i\'ve stayed. The problem here is you dont have that luxury, as you need to watch the server for problems.\\n\\n\\n \\"Just today I got Rdmed 8 times in a row...\\" \\n\\nThis I\'ve had the same, minus the traps. They must be all like... I want his laugh, pew pew. Either way, by the time I start and the time I end, around 3-6 hours of gameplay, I usualy get an average of 15 rdm caused deaths, excluding the people who mass rdm, and excluding the people who I thought were, but had a dna scanner. Why am I not flooding the forums with ban requests? Generally they do it once or twice, and I dont get enough solid evidence or, I call in someone to the server to settle it directly. \\nI derailed a second there... back on this quote, I myself would have no qualms with you kicking someone for this situation you described.\\n\\n\\n \\"I told everybody \'\'ACTIVATE TRAP AS INNOCENT IS RDM\'\' but they still do it.\\" \\n\\nI completely agree with this, but sadly, the problem is, people dont read or listen 90% of the time. This also atributes to the whole \\"It\'s [insert name]---\\" then die... and no one killing them.\\n\\n\\n \\"I can\'t even have an upside down name but Russian and Japanese names are alright.\\" \\n\\nThis is the only point I will argue against you... your name rightside up is \\"that guy\\" which is still confusing... while the japanese/russian names... we just call em japanese/russian dude. That\'s why I nicknamed you bruu, as it\'s what nnjg slightly looks like upside down.\\n\\n\\n \\"...but the new guys, I don\'t think they even like me and just want me gone.\\" \\n\\nI\'ve noticed that too while you were on, and I could not understand why, you seemed nice to me. I can honestly say, I\'d rather have you around then quite a few others i\'ve seen on the server.\\n\\n\\n \\"and before u ask, no I\'m not making any of it up, My Mom\'s Dead, my Fathers Dying, I\'m Alone here, and my future is looking Grim.\\" \\n\\nI\'ve had a bad string of events myself, this is easily believable from where i\'ve come from... Considering the shear emotion behind the post, I\'d actually be more shocked if anyone did not believe you.\\n\\n\\n \\"If anything i might just need a break since im already under a lot of pressure.\\" \\n\\nI dont want to sound like a jerk or anything, but I agree. Not because I want you gone, but because I want you to focus on making everything stable, and relaxing... going onto a server you have to moderate is work, as not only do you have to pay attention to everything that goes on, trying to weed out problems, but you also have to deal with both mod/admin haters in addition to people who generally troll, but are not bannable/too problematic.\\n\\n\\nI want you to take some time, reflect if staying here is right for you... and if its not, I hope to see you when you are ready to come back."},{"postId":19762,"topicId":2471,"posterId":521,"postTime":1303899082,"postText":"Man if they bitch about that just mute em. You don\'t need anyone telling you that you\'re abusing when you\'re punishing someone, its just retarded. If they whine about you punishing people they deserve a mute."},{"postId":19766,"topicId":2471,"posterId":112,"postTime":1303906093,"postText":"Tbh I agree with you. I find myself bouncing back and forth from jail to TTT because I can\'t handle the stupidity of some of the people.\\n\\nI also completely agree with the abusing. It seems to be everytime a mod joins the game he slaps somebody, and at the same time people are trying to demote VIPs for doing the exact same thing. I was actually going to write a rant about the slapping yesterday, bur I was too tired.\\n\\nAs for the Rdmers with the traps, I would kick or ban them if you gave a warning.\\n\\nI really have no comment on the Rdmers. EVERYBODY complains we have constant Rdmers on every server, yet we get about one ban request a week. (To everybody except that guy) Boo Hoo. Getting proof is hard. \\nExcept it\'s really not. If you look at my photobucket I have about 200 pictures of people breaking rules from hl2l. I didn\'t just whine asking for the admins to fix it. I got proof and got them banned so I could have fun. I suggest you either do the same or just stop complaining.\\n\\nAs for your Family, I\'m really sorry to hear that, I hope your Dad can get better, either way though atleast you can still be with him. Good luck with everything.\\n\\n\\nI\'d rather you took a break now than you stay then quit NNJG in a month. If you don\'t think you can handle it then don\'t stress yourself about it. You have alot going on. Just comeback when you can.\\n\\nEdit: Forgot about the complainers\\n\\nAbout the people complaining when you slap:\\nIf they are admin/mod disrepecting then ban them\\nIf they are trolling kick them\\nAnd if they just won\'t drop it even after you tell them to numerous times, just mute/gag them. ( which will most likely result in a ban for them because they\'ll rejoin and start disrepecting)\\n\\n And please if you are going to post here make it an intelligent comment. \\nAnd...

I do try to only slap myself, and in the end it\'ll most likely kill me if it worked, or slap Over or Bewm, because they know I\'m only joking around with them. If someone asks me to slap them, yeah I will, but I do try too keep it limited to mods or myself if I have to. \\n\\nI will also try and cut down on slapping, as I seem to have caused a bit of grief in Pharaoh :( For that I am sorry."},{"postId":19779,"topicId":2471,"posterId":2,"postTime":1303925172,"postText":">> \\nI will also try and cut down on slapping, as I seem to have caused a bit of grief in Pharaoh :( For that I am sorry. \\nYou should  never  use commands unless they\'re needed."},{"postId":19790,"topicId":2471,"posterId":605,"postTime":1303936456,"postText":">> EVERYBODY complains we have constant Rdmers on every server, yet we get about one ban request a week. (To everybody except that guy) Boo Hoo. Getting proof is hard. \\nExcept it\'s really not. \\nA good portion of the people who complain about rdm usualy dont know how to demo record, or are too lazy to, and just complain... where as some of people who are rdmed, either end up just getting shot down to half hp, or killed once every so often, making it hard to produce a full demo, as people are uncertain if they will keep rdming, and stop demo recording. Screenshots have no value in that later point, as it\'s too spread out for screenshots to be effective... more so when most people dont know they can use ttt_printdamage_log at the end of the round/forget to.\\nSure, if everyone became nonemotional machines with only the drive to make sure every problem is weeded out, instead of having fun, im sure it would be as easy as you claim. But the problem is emotions, not many humans can function logically while under a deal of stress.\\nTo the people who think about getting demos/screenshots, then decide it\'s too much work, I would agree with Pharaoh, you have no right to complain about rdm.\\n\\n\\nBut that was off topic, i\'m really more intersted in bruu, if he stays or not... either way, I hope things end up working out for him.\\n/me hopes he replies sometimes before I commence my fire meeting...
