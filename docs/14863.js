It\'s just a really tall tower, in which you must get past all of the obstacles while climbing to the top. Bet you can\'t tell where its influence came from ;p. Though, I did decide to add a bonus, those who climb to the top, must then climb back down by any means they see fit.\\n\\nAnd some specifics;\\nAmount of puzzles: around 14.\\nDifficulty: starts around 1/5, and end up being around 4/5.\\nAtmosphere: a gaint tower, in which you must get to the top, and back down. Uses the textures used in confused peice with basic lighting.\\nShortcuts: only a few very minor time savers here n there, only capable of cutting a few seconds off of some specific puzzles.\\nSecrets: Just 1 lonely secret room.\\n\\nChangelog from v1m1-v1m2;\\nIma strangle pakrat, the end. At least I caught it before it was uploaded this time.\\n\\nChangelog from v1m2-v2m3;\\nChanged 3 puzzles, making 2 a tiny bit more difficult, and one easier.\\nChanged how the secret rooms deals its damage.\\nAdded in the \\"constructed by\\" and \\"nnjg\\" images. Cant believe I forgot those..."},{"postId":34732,"topicId":4389,"posterId":4,"postTime":1317600148,"postText":"I liked it.
