Instead of just hiding the name, you get to choose a person on the server (alive or dead) and take their name.  This would actually make the disguiser worth the credit.   It would no longer be a dead-giveaway.  I don\'t think it would be too big of an advantage to the traitors, either.  What do you guys think?"},{"postId":5805,"topicId":645,"posterId":112,"postTime":1282268925,"postText":"That would be really cool, but wouldn\'t that lead to people having crappy karma due to them attacking innocents? :/"},{"postId":5807,"topicId":645,"posterId":128,"postTime":1282269911,"postText":"What pharaoh said. Also disguiser is really useful when you\'re sniping or shooting someone from a distance and they can see you but cant shoot back. It prevents them from saying \\"it\'s _____\\".
