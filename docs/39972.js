A ddos is a planned attack in which the person can send a request through a rat or a booter to all of their or a certain number of slaves( an infected computer) or shells ( an php script hosted on the internet)  to send large amounts of packets to the target\'s roughter, which in return overwhelms it and cuts off reletive access to the internet. My question is won\'t this method just track the individual shells or the infected computers it is getting the packets from?. Because the only possible way to get to the person that initated the ddos is to track the shell to the web based client then from the web based client (which you would have to get admin access to first) to the user who initated the attack. And their is almost no way to trace it back to a rat...so again won\'t this only track the shells xD"},{"postId":22712,"topicId":2823,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306286134,"postText":"In the end you can detect who is the one who initially implanted the attack, or set off the \\"shells\\" as you call them. If you trace the original source of what started the attack you can there in find who\'s IP initiated it and report them to the police who will in turn report it to FBI or someone of higher power. Since IP tracking is legal (which a lot of people don\'t understand) you can do this with no worries."},{"postId":22714,"topicId":2823,"posterId":705,"postTime":1306288052,"postText":"Hmm I haven\'t heard of this in my research and knowledge on this subject, when I get a laptop I would like to further research this tech and see if it is legit."},{"postId":22723,"topicId":2823,"posterId":153,"postTime":1306293303,"postText":"How would you locate the attackers IP, especially if the attackers network wasnt used to attack the server"},{"postId":22726,"topicId":2823,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306294133,"postText":"If you trace one of the IPs used you can track further to see what IP initiated that one.

If im using correct terminology, which i doubt since im not a programmer, but i believe thats how my bro explained it to me. (he is a programmer) \\nThere is a lot more if you would like to trace back so to say because most shells such as jackle-shell,syrian-shell and a varity of others are programmed to not keep the ip of the client who initated the attack therefore that would eliminate tracking most of the web based booters which is what most inexpierenced people use. That leaves rats and non web-based booter clients and what they do is use the slaves(an infected computer in a botnet) internet to send massive amounts of packets. The only way to backtrack that would be to find the virus on their computer(which is always encrypted and hidden XD) and decode that to find what dns the hacker is using then, call the company. Who hosts the dns and ask for the logs of the dns the slave is reporting to.which you would have to have some sort of legal authority to do bye the way then, hand that over to the authorities who won\'t give a shit because because they don\'t care about someone getting ddosed unless they are the fucking cia or obama.\\nSo all said I highly doubt that this could happen.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add that the connection between the hacker and the slave is encrypted.\\nAnd most hackers and some skids use a vpn.I personally use cyberghost so that\'s another step in the equation"},{"postId":22732,"topicId":2823,"posterId":54,"postTime":1306299694,"postText":"most ddos attackers, have a vpn so they won\'t get caught.\\na few friends of mine can confirm that."},{"postId":22734,"topicId":2823,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306301750,"postText":"Just gonna put this out there, EVERYTHING can be traced.

(im not getting paid so i dont care personally about trying to solve DDOS issues) \\nYeah if you get the right guy to do it. I\'m just saying that people put up a shithole of loopholes to trick someone and most high end companies don\'t care about the person who initated the ddos they just care about the damage and furthur exploit from the ddos. That being said I don\'t think anyone short of a security major would have a chance of tracing a properly shielded attack."},{"postId":22799,"topicId":2823,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306373333,"postText":"True, but heres the good part. 90% of DDOS atks are from pissed off little kids. So likely hood of it being shielded is down about 50-60%. Since most normal minded people know wtf the did to get banned in first place. (bout 50-75% of DDOS atks are prolly from people banned)"},{"postId":22801,"topicId":2823,"posterId":705,"postTime":1306375921,"postText":"Yeah most of the people who ddos are little skiddies think they are 1337 h4x0rs because they can copy a server ip and click a button... they arnt the ones to worry about. its the ones who have like 400 bots and ddos for like 3 days or longer."}]}')}}]);
