You could chop through a team of innos, a forrest, and if you had the ammo, a small village. The P90 on the other had was the opposit. It would take maybe two to two-in-a-half clips to kill someone... I could have called my grandmother to tell her who was shooting at me. Then she would drive over, get on the computer, and kick there ass... In that very same round.\\n\\nBut now the tmp is shit... and P90 is rape-tastic... I liked it better when tmp was op v.v"},{"postId":21970,"topicId":2730,"posterId":101,"postTime":1305574458,"postText":"P90 STILL sucks, what are you talking about? :/\\n\\nReally Mac10 TMP AK47 and the P90 are almost all the same exact same guns."},{"postId":22108,"topicId":2730,"posterId":79,"postTime":1305674773,"postText":"The ONLY weapon the upgrades should also effect is the TMP, which is pretty much a Mac10 with a silencer."},{"postId":22155,"topicId":2730,"posterId":634,"postTime":1305687175,"postText":"Here are 5 opinions i have about the smgs present in the TTT gamemod.                           1. The ak47 does suck. 2. The p90 and mac10 are about avg ( very balanced ) 3. Mac10 with upgrades is borderline op. 4. The tmp is only a little bit more effective than the ak47. 5. Nothing is too overpowered or underpowered to need changing as of now."},{"postId":22156,"topicId":2730,"posterId":79,"postTime":1305688320,"postText":"Anyone who thinks AK sux is just not smart.
