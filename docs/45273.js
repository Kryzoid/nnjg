No, this isn\'t the old idea, continue reading:\\n\\nWhen you go to buy a house (or apartment), you are given the option to either pay in full, or make payments. We were thinking somewhere around the lines of $2500 each week, and after 4 weeks, the house is yours. Either that, or a sliding scale. Depending on the price of your house, you pay a fraction of that each week for 4 weeks. If you pay in full, possibly have it $1000 cheaper compared to making payments? And if you don\'t log onto the server for 30 days, then your house goes for sale for 2/3 the normal price. This makes people come back to check on their belongings. \\n\\nAnother suggestion: Permanent items. Meaning items don\'t remove themselves after disconnecting. Is it possible to make items not get removed after crashes, or if you yourself crash? It\'s annoying when you crash after buying a lot of things and having it all wasted.\\n\\nThis would also go well with permanent houses, and have an actual reason to buy an alarm system (Or make one, I know there was an alarm system in PERP 1), and there would actually be something to do if you have a lockpick. \\n\\nPossibly have an upgraded lock you can make, or you can buy, that prevents the usual lockpick from being used on your door? Or maybe make it have less of a chance to actually open your door, and if there\'s a failed attempt it alerts the police?"},{"postId":23252,"topicId":2904,"posterId":488,"postTime":1307082996,"postText":"This.

If we\'re even going to CONSIDER giving someone a permnant house or a house that stays their even after they leave, the price has to be jacked up A LOT. I\'m talking 10-15k a week (for renting, not paying off a mortgage or leasing it), and around 200-500k for permnant. Nobody can buy more than one, and if they were going to buy one, it wouldnt be made so you pay a certain amount every week. Straight up all the cash. If you\'re on the whole week, you should have no problem making 20-70k every week.\\n\\nI fail to see how having a permnant house will give a good reason for buying an alarm system such as in perp 1. It only notifies the authorities if I recall correctly.\\n\\nIf you buy an item, and the server crashes, your item should NOT dissapear. It would only dissapear if you have it equipped or have it placed in the map. \\n\\nThe refund matter in which Pharaoh mentioned is still being debated."},{"postId":23297,"topicId":2904,"posterId":760,"postTime":1307132712,"postText":"I am exploring the Source SDK, and it would be possible to make many copies of the house/apartment in some area, and teleport the player when he walks in/out.
