As some of you know, I own the CS:S server. And, as more of you know, it\'s unpopulated and DarK_St3alth used to be the one in control of it. Now for the time being, I am asking...\\n\\nWho wants control of the server? You can edit and add anything you like, besides admins. After you do what you want with it, I will suspend you account and change all admin-related files back to what they were. You will be given vip on the server, once we find some plugins for it... Ideas are always welcome. It will be running Sourcemod.\\n\\nIf you have a plugin you want the server to use, but don\'t want the responsibility of changing the server, then post the plugin. Make sure it\'s a public one, no megaupload or file hosting sites please.\\n\\nAnd you cannot have any control over it if you signed up after December 1st, 2010."}]}')}}]);
