The RP names are mediocre at best, not saying we should get rid of them, but at least make the names decent? Also, i think in the menu, VIPs should have the right to see real names next to RP names. (That whole grudge thing comes into play if everyone could see it, however.)"},{"postId":36942,"topicId":4659,"posterId":634,"postTime":1320259098,"postText":">> but what if someone perhaps got killed by someone last round, and knew their name, then went ahead and freekills them next round? \\nThis would rid only the guard RP names, not the prisoner RP names.

Now yes, it makes more sense to remove only guard names, but then again, I feel some people would then go on and complain about how \\"Everyone can see guard names, but guards can\'t see prisoner\'s names.\\" And then we would go back into another debate such as this one.
