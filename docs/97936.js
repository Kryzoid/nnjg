Need to make it so if you get a T ally blatantly killed (sticking with them non-stop when they tell you not to OR when u shoot someone and run behind them so ur not called out) that you get slayed or some type of punishment. Im sick of having a fucking ally that i tell NOT to do something cause im around or too many people watching and they still do it. Not only do i get blatantly killed, but my dumbass ally gets away without being called out.\\n\\nAlso, LAUGHING about getting your traitor ally killed after needs to be especially punishable."},{"postId":24068,"topicId":3027,"posterId":389,"postTime":1308104028,"postText":"THAT FUCKING HAPPENED TO ME :)\\nI RDMED HIM HEHEHEHE :)\\n\\nWas that player Merlin?"},{"postId":24072,"topicId":3027,"posterId":79,"postTime":1308104317,"postText":"Actually this has been happening often as well as being individually targeted by Storm. Gash\'s little get Crisis mad buddy so i can ban him. If he\'s not your buddy Gash so be it, but he keeps saying you and him talk about how you want me banned.\\n\\nBut, just in general we need a god damn rule about this where we can post proof of trolls/assholes getting their Traitor allies killed."},{"postId":24074,"topicId":3027,"posterId":634,"postTime":1308104621,"postText":"Just make it so the Following rule applies to Traitor Teamates also.

If they are doing it to Troll or Get you killed it ,at least in my book, Should be a Ban."},{"postId":24079,"topicId":3027,"posterId":79,"postTime":1308104903,"postText":"I agree, it should be a slay/ban since it is intentionally getting your ally rdm\'d instead of yourself. But since no rule is currently \\"active\\" on this exact matter, most people get away with doing it without consequence. I can see if it rarely happens not to need this but it has happened half a dozen times in a day, something needs to be done about this matter imo."},{"postId":24080,"topicId":3027,"posterId":389,"postTime":1308105170,"postText":"Are you sure thats not for innocents and detectives only cause if you killed them.... you be team killing and blah people probably be on the dead guy\'s side. Cause in their eyes its \\"He purposely killed his traitor buddy, lets slay/kick/ban him!.\\"\\n\\nAnd if there was no admin/mod around to ask for situation.\\n\\nIt\'ll probably end up like this \\"Okay, I got the guy\'s steam id, Ill give it an admin later\\", which potentially ends up in a banning of an innocent guy.\\n\\nThe above is for potentially the bad situations.

If you kill them the next round, you get punished. So no matter what happens all the punishment lies on the guy who had his ally get him killed. \\n\\nI kill him for getting me called out. (slay or ban, depending on warnings)\\nI kill him the next round for doing it previous (slay or ban for blatant rdm, depending on warnings)\\n\\nI understand that this rule would be hard to enforce, but at the same time its not. If 1 guy just runs by (has to run that specific direction) and other waits till right next to him knife/attack someone, you will get called out even if your innocent.

Especially when the innocent that kills you believes that he wasn\'t wrong and also when your traitor buddy just doesn\'t talk at all or ignores the fact or something along those lines. \\n\\nThus overall, you be the one whose in  tragic scenario. You can\'t do anything about it, and if you do. People will not believe you or some might? OR you do something about that guy and gg for you for 2 days.
