I thought she was really pretty, and we started talking, and she was really cool. After a while of talking to her, I found it sketchy. Like, she was beyond pretty. So I looked through all the messages, and I saw she loved Lady gaga and she loved reading. So, Leslie\'s cousin was in town. And guess what? She loves Lady Gaga and she loves reading. So, I pretty much assumed it was them. Although I couldn\'t really prove it, but I pretty much knew. I wasn\'t going to say anything about it. Then I was sleeping over at Leslie\'s house one night, and she was showing me her art room. She started showing me her door, how she painted stuff on it, then she closed it real fast sort of. On the back, it had a name. \\"Jaime Lovett\\". The girl Sonny, told me how she put \\"Jaime Lovett\\" on a wall cause she didn\'t know what else to put. So I was confident it was them now.\\n\\nSo, I asked Leslie on facebook yesterday. I asked \\"So, why did you and your cousin make that Sonny facebook?\\" We started talking about it, and I was saying how I wouldn\'t want to talk to her because she was on a fake facebook. So, it made Leslie mad. (there\'s reasons why, but I won\'t say those reasons). And, she got really pissed at me. I told her:\\n\\n\\"I never said I know your cousin. and I can understand that I guess, you\'re the only reason I have confidence about myself. I shouldn\'t have said anything, cause it seems like I just made you mad..\\"\\n\\nThen she posted on facebook saying \\"I guess you lost your confidence.\\" \\n\\nAnd that just really, really crushed me. I felt like fucking dying, legit. This girl, has been my best friend since the beginning. She means the world to me. If I lost her, I don\'t think I would be around for much longer afterwards. \\n\\nSo, after that, I felt like shit. So I sent her cousin a message on her real facebook saying I knew it was her and stuff. We started talking, and she\'s still the same person. Who the fuck cares about faces. Then, I texted Leslie saying I\'m sorry and that I talked to her cousin. She said that \\"it\'s whatever\\" And, after that, we were cool again. I felt a little better, but still felt like shit. I went to her brothers concert at night, and it was really good. Everyone seemed happy, and she totally didn\'t seem mad at me. Everyone had a smile on their face, it was a really good experience. \\n\\nSo, that\'s why I was depressed. I\'m better now, all is well. thanks everyone for giving me good luck wishes. <3 you all :)"},{"postId":28994,"topicId":3602,"posterId":856,"postTime":1313247738,"postText":"pretty long story, but its good that you\'re better"},{"postId":29014,"topicId":3602,"posterId":812,"postTime":1313253925,"postText":"Shit man, that\'s why I just smoke bitches and fuck weed bro.\\n\\nSame shit kinda happened to me back in like 8th grade, some girl played me ass but I recovered mainly because she was sluttier than I am :\\\\"},{"postId":29054,"topicId":3602,"posterId":769,"postTime":1313269132,"postText":"This is why I fucking hate facebook.\\n\\nBut I\'m glad you\'re okay, man.
