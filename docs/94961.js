It looks good. But maybe on the right would be the general chat box and put servers in their own tab like was said. Color design looks ok for the most part, i feel if looking at it for longer periods of time though the colors might blend in too well. So dunno if a different color scheme would look better or not, just a thought to try others see whats liked most."},{"postId":27178,"topicId":3412,"posterId":82,"postTime":1312160431,"postText":"There is a disconnect in styles, on one hand we have the, for the most part, dark and blue background with square, blocky font and up in the corner is \\"New\\" in a completely different style, this trend follows into the four server buttons, each uses a completely different style, I personally think there should be some more continuity throughout the design. Other than those nitpicks, it\'s great!"},{"postId":27180,"topicId":3412,"posterId":2,"postTime":1312160869,"postText":"I\'d love to see what a sleek white and black version of that would look like."},{"postId":27182,"topicId":3412,"posterId":112,"postTime":1312163034,"postText":"I love it. 98% of it. xD\\n\\nI don\'t like the font of the tabs or the Nonerdsjustgeeks.
