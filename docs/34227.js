I know the admins try their best and really want to help the server but its so off track that I cant believe that the admins haven\'t gave up on the server yet I mean come on admin will come in fix the problem 10 minutes later its happening again. So I would like to give all the admins who work and try to keep the server sane respect, they try so hard and no one even cares But a couple of people. So I would like to ask you, do you think you would last one day in their shoes would you act up as much if you had to do what they do every single day of the week."},{"postId":14440,"topicId":1686,"posterId":392,"postTime":1295322182,"postText":"welcome to forums wannabemod^^\\n\\nyea jailbreak is unplayable right now so much shit goin\'\' on in there"},{"postId":14443,"topicId":1686,"posterId":481,"postTime":1295324709,"postText":"Truth I really dont care I only play thair jailbreak and today i called swaim to help he was pissed and said why dont I atleast try I cant lose anything.(Now git back on sub)     \\n\\nYa but  it is unplable with all the new players."},{"postId":14461,"topicId":1686,"posterId":366,"postTime":1295367641,"postText":">> Truth I really dont care I only play thair jailbreak and today i called swaim to help he was pissed and said why dont I atleast try I cant lose anything.(Now git back on sub)     \\n\\nYa but  it is unplable with all the new players. \\nThe only reason I was mad was because, every time I go onto that server it\'s always chaos, every time I fix it it\'s nice for awhile but, 15 minutes later after I leave, \\"FREEKILLER\\" \\"YOU DIDN\'T FELLLOO DU RULES\\" THERE WER NAO ORDERS GIBEN\\" FREEKILL?\\" HOWS ABOUT A FREEKILL\\" admin abnmin\\" \\"I am 12 and what is this\\". Oh and don\'t think it\'s new people that joined NOPE, it\'s the same fucking people that I took an hour out of my day explaining how to play. So my efforts are worthless unless there\'s some order amongst the server regulations. Also I really need some way to make people read the rules when I ask them, SERIOUSLY THIS MAKES ME RAGE EVERY TIME, READ THE FUCKING THING THAT SHOWS UP EVERY TIME YOU FUCKING JOIN, AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME, LE DERP. They always ask how do you switch teams, hurrrrrrrrrrrrr, obviously didn\'t read the rules, and then sure enough they yell, \\"freeeeeee kelllll\\" and there was an order by the warden that they didn\'t fallow, WHAT THE DICKS?\\n\\nMy apologize for my bad grammar and spelling during the fallowing story, but I raged a bit while typing it, also some of it was meant to be bad grammar and bad spelling to show how stupid some of these people are."},{"postId":14462,"topicId":1686,"posterId":389,"postTime":1295369350,"postText":"I know how you feel swaim kinda. Even though I\'m not a mod on the jailbreak, I\'ve played a couple times.\\n\\nex. Yesterday, there was a freekiller and Mak banned the guy. Like 2 mins later, BAM another freekiller.\\n\\nTheres always a constant amount of people breaking rules and such. This is actually very annoying and stressing for the mods / admins of the server. People might often think that being a mod / admin is like \\"Woot, I have powers and I\'m better than others. This is gonna be fun.\\", which might be true for a short term, but eventually it will be something stressing.\\n\\nTheres a few people taking a leave from the servers such a Pharoah and some other people.\\n\\n\\nAlso in the several times, I\'ve played at the server. The guards aren\'t doing shit or aren\'t doing shit about the freekilling guards. Like apart from the admins / mods, the community / the players aren\'t doing what they are suppose to do. They might think that it just playing and doing whatever, but they play a major part in creating the atmosphere and how the game goes. Currently the server is like a storm with lightning, tornadoes, hurricanes, and tsunamis. Its a huge chaotic messy community."},{"postId":14556,"topicId":1686,"posterId":392,"postTime":1295473524,"postText":"I wouldn\'t mind being a mod on jailbreak but i\'m under qualified right now x.x"},{"postId":14557,"topicId":1686,"posterId":39,"postTime":1295473597,"postText":">> Theres a few people taking a leave from the servers such a Pharoah and some other people. \\n\\n*Spits up water*\\nPharaoh, you gots some explainings to do.\\n\\nBut seriously now, its not that the servers out of control, its just that people get butthurt a lot. Sure there are people breaking rules, and we do deal with them, but 9/10 times someone says that they got freekilled they just tried pulling a fucking AK on the guard. It doesn\'t work like that, and this causes everyone to start complaining over someone whose playing the game quite correctly.\\n\\nAlso zemey, no. Never.
