This is why no one shot me. I then proceeded to kill you, in belief that you lied about killing those Ts, as you wouldnt have been the first. After we talked about this situation, I decided to ignore it as a problem with the mic limit.\\n\\nNext you false called me out a second time, saying that I knifed someone and editing their last words to prove it. Sure, if anyone payed attention, they would have known it was a lie, but ttt is known to have a few slower players in there.\\nAs shown in this image below, the first part of the highlighted area is the guys real last words... at the end of the highlighted area is what you claimed the last words were, and said to kos me off of them. As such, I once again kosed you for it, and said I\'d kill you when I saw you for false callout, a T act.\\n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/577810212121709920/04D2EF77D6923C0B3CED0D2226C70BC1A323C197/ \\n\\nAfterwards. you claimed I rdmed, despite how many times I\'d explain it. Link has one such proof that I tried to explain that I kosed you for it, but you kept pushing it off as you were only joking about kosing me, and that I rdmed you.\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Udane/screenshot/577810212121713270/?tab=public\\n\\nNow, you did infact say to me privately at first that the server was going to be ddosed in steam. But afterwards, you said in game the server is probably going to get ddosed. Not long after, you said you were being ddosed. I made a remark that the server wasnt being ddosed, that you were wrong and had nothing to worry about. Although why you were talking to the group of sethhackers, i\'d never know.\\nAlso, it had an effect, but mostly in players pming me if it was true or not, probably because players were afraid of mentioning it in the server.\\n\\nThe ban was not based on what gash has informed me, I was only basically asking him if you may have been having an off day, or if this is something I should keep an eye on.\\n\\nThough, you mentioned it was a week, this was not was it meant to be, I edited it the same night for 5 days, but it must not have gone through. I use sm_admin for my bans, to be 100% sure copy n paste doesnt screw me over. It\'s kinda lacking on the option of time for banning."},{"postId":34940,"topicId":4407,"posterId":82,"postTime":1317874293,"postText":"Edit: I don\'t want this anymore, lock it, please."},{"postId":34944,"topicId":4407,"posterId":605,"postTime":1317878686,"postText":"Show me one player who can comfirm you did in fact say that, you can\'t because no one corrected me, no one said that you said only suspect me, not even you corrected me, during the 2 or 3 minutes it took to find you.\\nYou claim they are the same \\"rdm\\" and that im making up two seperate stories for it, but then admit to there being two seperate occurances, which is what I listed.\\nI said in private chat the ban was also based on what gash told me, because of the fact that I wasnt sure if you were if something was just wrong with you, or if you\'ve been doing things like this for a while.\\nYou were banned for repeated false callouts and trolling. Otherwise, if a man rdms one man per round, and gets his slay each time, he would never get banned. He would just keep rdming over and over.\\n\\nThe more we talk, the more it looks like you\'re attempting to get me falsely banned from nnjg."},{"postId":34957,"topicId":4407,"posterId":82,"postTime":1317910040,"postText":"Edit: I don\'t want this anymore, lock it, please."},{"postId":34976,"topicId":4407,"posterId":605,"postTime":1317939384,"postText":"Again, I said before the slap why you were getting the slap, otherwise, I wouldnt have \\"scrolled up to hide the fact that it happened\\" instead of scrolling down. Though I wasn\'t scrolling to hide it, I was scrolling to show that both of the images were of the same timezone when matched up.\\n\\"I don\'t care if you \'\'killed\'\' two innos, I\'m still kosing you for calling me out\\" was my reasoning that I explained over the mic. For one as shrewd as you, it\'s entirely possible you pretended to kill the Ts as a T, to help prove yourself, or even further, one of the Ts told you to kill them to prove yourself.\\n\\nSecondly, \\n>> \\nYou were banned for repeated false callouts and trolling. Otherwise, if a man rdms one man per round, and gets his slay each time, he would never get banned. He would just keep rdming over and over. \\n\\nAnd once again, the \\"retracted\\" callout was not retracted. As I said, no one corrected me as if I missheard anything, not even you. If it was retracted, you just let me come up and kill you. I didnt hear that it was retracted, no one corrected me, therefore, either your mic limit cut in during this \\"retraction\\" or it was a false callout. Considering how you decided to false call me out again, and in addition, troll, I decided I did hear a false callout, and treated it as such.\\n\\nWe already went over the ddos comment, and again, the pushing someone into a T room didnt play a roll in the ban length.\\n\\nIf you\'re just gonna keep playing the same song, the post is just going to go in cirlces, and may as well lock it."},{"postId":34985,"topicId":4407,"posterId":82,"postTime":1317945632,"postText":"Edit: I don\'t want this anymore, lock it, please."},{"postId":34991,"topicId":4407,"posterId":605,"postTime":1317951674,"postText":"I find it humorous it took you 2 days to gather another players comment against what I said, and came up with rose, who\'s already been against me. More over, rose claimed that I confirmed that you said you retracted your statement? If this is the case, this is falsified evidence, and will get rose banned permanetly. Like I said, no one corrected me on what you said, if anyone, even you, spoke up and said that the kos was retracted, you\'d be alive. Ask anyone who plays on the server reguraly, I don\'t kill randomly, and even if I accidently do, I slay myself the next round, even if they said its ok that I killed them.\\nAgain, why would I have to \\"scroll up to hide it\\" if I slapped you before I told you about it. If I slapped you beforehand, I would have to scroll down, as the slap would have occured before why I explained myself. I didn\'t avoid the slap, as it has no value in the ban, I decided it wasn\'t worthy of being mentioned... but you keep bringing it up as if its the devil\'s cry.\\nAgain, the trolling was not about what gash has spoke, it was about the \\"joke\\" about the server getting ddosed. The only reason the topic of gash coming up, I was only attempting to confirm if you were just having a seriously off day, or that you have been at this kind of thing recently.\\n\\nEdit: Look between both of the 2 images i posted up there, and show me where i slapped you before explaining why i killed you. The two images are seemlessly linked, the altering of the last words in both images."},{"postId":34997,"topicId":4407,"posterId":82,"postTime":1317955059,"postText":"Edit: I don\'t want this anymore, lock it, please."}]}')}}]);
