I was NNJG\'s most dedicated player for months. I was even an moderator and admin for a majority of that time. I created the group logo, and I am (very slowly) working on a new one with matching forums. I joined the group a long time ago, for the hell of it, I have no negative feelings towards Gash, I respect him.
