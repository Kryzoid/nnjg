A lot of people complain about the state of the game now but it\'s not like they removed content, only built on top of it. \\n\\nAlthough I have to agree with the crate and key system being a very tacky feeling moneygrab. That and all their effort for a non-grindable drop system which no one asked for resulted in basically grinding time by idling. That and the more new weapons they add the less likely you are to get something you want as a drop. Oh, that and deciding that the Heavy, a class with the highest dps and most health and mammoth overheal in the game, should also be more mobile, and have reduced spin-up time, and be able to heal to full health in 5 seconds or heal half their health instantaneously.\\n\\nJeez I\'m sure complaining a lot for a game I love. But basically, barnone, no other multiplayer fps has the charm and replayability that TF2 has. If you ever get a little bored in that game you can change classes and try a completely different playstyle. Personally I\'ve played and been playing a revolver-heavy spy as of late. And when I think about it, is probably why I favor deagle so much in TTT."},{"postId":26003,"topicId":3280,"posterId":4,"postTime":1311359170,"postText":"I don\'t like how the game has turned out due to the whole trading system and Mann Co.

Was it at least an unusual hat?\\n\\nFor those of you lucky enough to not know about this bullshit, allow me to explain. TF2 has hats. Hats are rare. They do absolutely nothing, purely cosmetic, no stat changes or anything. Only thing it does is when people look at you wearing a dapper hat they don\'t have they can feel jealous. Fantastic. Except one day Valve added Unusual hats. They are nothing more than the same hats already in game except a random particle effect attached to them, like sunbeams or green plasma or flies buzzing around. Well how do you get these hats? Why crack open a crate. How do you open a crate? Why use a key. How do you get these keys? Well pay $2.50 USD for a one-time use key. The only other method to get a key is to trade your meager trickle of  dropped hats and hat-crafting materials with someone else who bought a key. Either way, someone is paying. Oh one more thing. Getting an unusual hat from a crate you opened is extremely rare, less than a percent chance. More often that not you\'ll get your standard boring weapons. Only $2.50. Hooray!\\n\\nNaturally you hear horror stories of people who spend upwards of $600 cracking open crates to still not find an unusual. My best advice is never, EVER buy keys. If you really feel the need to crack open a crate for a precious precious hat for your game doll, trade for a key. You\'ll feel much better when you find that shotgun that you didn\'t spend your money like a chump.\\n\\nAs for vintage hats, vintage hats are the same as regular hats except they weren\'t crafted or bought. They were introduced at the same time people got the ability to buy hats so basically if you owned any hats before the MANNCONOMY update launched time they were \\"upgraded\\" to vintage hats. The only difference is the hat\'s name appears in blue font instead of yellow font and has \\"Vintage\\" tacked on to the front of the name. So for example I could have \\"Soldier\'s Stash\\" as a hat for my soldier or a \\"Vintage Soldier\'s Stash\\". Same hat, worth more in a trade. But heres a little protip from me. No one in-game can tell if the hat you\'re wearing is vintage or not. Even in their deathcam that might sometimes show what weapon you\'re holding, its name and stats, it\'ll never showoff a hat. I\'ve seen people even go so far as to waste valuable items to re-name their hat and write a new description for it  that no one besides them will be able to see. "},{"postId":26010,"topicId":3280,"posterId":4,"postTime":1311362233,"postText":"It was a Max\'s Severed Head that i achieved in a trade in exchange for a Bill\'s Hat, and a few vintage hats and crates. What a steal!\\n\\nAnyways, about what you said about people never being able to see if you have a vintage or non-vintage hat, that\'s partially true. If you look at a player in-game and press F (by default) It will show you the current items he/she has equipped, including hats. There\'s also backpack viewers  that can be used to  stalk  see people and their items.\\n\\nI\'ve established quite a collection of vintage items, but i\'m not going to lie, i do want an unusual because of the very reasons you stated about vintage hats. For now, all i can do is paint my vintage hats and hope that i can be somewhat unique among a crowd of people with the same hat."},{"postId":26037,"topicId":3280,"posterId":115,"postTime":1311373715,"postText":"When did you sell a severed head?\\n\\nThat is a steal :V"},{"postId":26050,"topicId":3280,"posterId":595,"postTime":1311382245,"postText":"I sold a couple of rare hats for $300.
