I was banned for trucing. Now hear me out, It was one of those hostage situations that Player and Kryzoid has done a few times, Right now I\'m in the server, I was with Blue Panda at the time and he had said himself \\"If i thought it was bad I would have punished you.\\" Now I love NNJG and its community, In-fact its the only reason i play on TTT. Being banned from NNJG is like being banned from your favorite place to hang out, You never feel the same way there. Now i can say that if I don\'t get unbanned, So it will be but let it be known that I have a great passion for NNJG. If I were to be banned for any longer then I would be probably the saddest boy on earth.

This is trucing as he knows you are the T but does nothing about it, in addition to you handing off a c4 to an innocent.\\nIf an admin or moderator breaks a rule, it doesnt mean the rule is fine for everyone to break, it only means they are either ignorant/abusive/ect.\\nLastly, I am unaware of who this blue panda you speak of is. If he is a ttt admin/moderator who renamed himself for giggles, he should talk some rules over with gash about trucing."},{"postId":37274,"topicId":4805,"posterId":115,"postTime":1320592387,"postText":"Blue panda isn\'t someones alt, but a regular of TTT who I thought quit some time ago..."},{"postId":37276,"topicId":4805,"posterId":1035,"postTime":1320593215,"postText":"It wasn\'t for his personal use, It was for my use only, As a traitor its practically like a Viral bomb. It was NEVER for his use. I armed the C4 and then made him run around with it, Sometimes I pointed a gun at his face and made him do it, Sometimes I had a knife at his face.

Being as Gash feels this is trucing, I\'ve banned myself ( It\'s not fair for them to be punished under the same circumstances as I), and would also ask for the un-ban, or at least ban shortening, of both Arguyle and Neokiller. While I\'ve never forced another innocent to RDM another whilst taking part in the hostage situation, which obviously can be worthy of a ban, I have held hostages, and been held hostage. Thank you."},{"postId":37315,"topicId":4805,"posterId":634,"postTime":1320614304,"postText":">> I\'ve taken part in many hostage situations, not exactly to the extent of this one, but of the same principle.

It is against the rules, and has never been allowed. At no time will you ever be defenseless; if you don\'t have any other weapons, you can resort to using your crowbar. Neokiller has known this for awhile, and you should also know that by now.\\n\\nUnban denied, and Playerhata can keep his ban if he really wants to act as if it would make a difference in my judgement."}]}')}}]);
