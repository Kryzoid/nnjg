One I killed for killing another person who was innocent, one i killed for standing over an unidentified body (innocent), and one i killed for shooting at me. Another round people were chasing The Misfit, so i killed 2 or 3, one was a traitor. And others i killed for killing someone, etc. I was killing the people for good reasons, they just ended up to be rdmers or something, or the guy who was standing by the body might not have killed him, but i didn\'t know and i thought he did.

Yeah, they might have been unhappy, but it was a good cause and not at all rdm. I may have killed innocents, a few, but it was for good reasons. I\'m sorry for what I did, but it was all in defense. I thought I was doing right, they did something for me to kill them, and i wouldn\'t kill them if they did nothing. I love NNJG and I don\'t want a bad rep on it. NNJG has really good people and cool admins, I don\'t want to be away from it. I know two of the people IRL (not saying who) and I just want to have fun on the server. I admit, i have rdmed before, not much though to get a serious ban or what not. Sometimes just out of rage. Such as the dispute with me and The Misfit. Some people might remember. Please consider this request, I love NNJG."},{"postId":3116,"topicId":327,"posterId":13,"postTime":1276833014,"postText":"Sorry like I said if Super says unban, then you are unbanned.

And the ban itself was pretty unfair, I didn\'t get to tell my side of the story.
