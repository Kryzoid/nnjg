And I found out about this minecraft server on one the JailRP sever you guys have, a vip mentioned it, I don\'t remember who. I also don\'t have anyone on my friends list with the [nnjg] clan tag, since I don\'t add people who I don\'t know but if the person adds me then I will gladly accept. I am also learning alot of stuff on minecraft still and find myself playing maybe 3 to 4 hours a day, I also have a livestream account, which I will gladly stream multi-player from this sever if you guys are interested. So yeah this is my rant about myself. If there is anymore questions I will gladly answer."},{"postId":21764,"topicId":2690,"posterId":4,"postTime":1305353555,"postText":"Alright, whitelisted."}]}')}}]);
