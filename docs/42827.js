I knew that wasn\'t enough evidence to kill them so i waited, Then one of the two people says \\"I\'ve been with him the \'\'hole\'\' time, He has done nothing.\\" that gives me enough evidence to kill either one of them for both of them being with each other while 2 people got murdered(And then burned).\\n\\nTraitors killed: Ze Friendleh Spai, Mr. Tomato\\n http://i52.tinypic.com/2yo71hj.png "},{"postId":11029,"topicId":1176,"posterId":39,"postTime":1290123145,"postText":"That actually seems fairly reasonable.\\nI say unban."},{"postId":11031,"topicId":1176,"posterId":153,"postTime":1290124952,"postText":"People were complaining you were RDMing.\\nYou cannot kill out of suspicion.\\nYou had no reason to kill him, and especially to kill me.\\nPlus, it was yesterday and only a 2 day ban.\\nDenied."},{"postId":11035,"topicId":1176,"posterId":2,"postTime":1290137737,"postText":"Ben, I have to cut in here, his unban seems legit and a good reason.
