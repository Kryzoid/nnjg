Only one of them worked, but I forgot which one. Hopefully somone with more insight on coding could make them. Most of them won\'t be standard *PEW PEW* weapons, we have enough of those. Theese are weapons that are used best with quick thinking and waiting for the right moment, so if used correctly they will have tremendous effects.\\n\\n  The Manhack Remote  \\nGives player the ability to control up to 5 manhacks at a time. This will probably be best for finishing someone off, or causing chaos in large groups of people.\\nLeftclick-Sends comand to go where you clicked Rightclick-Spawns a manhack\\n+Makes it easier for traitors get wittle down health of innocents and detectives.\\n+Controlable from a distance.\\n-May lead to rdm in large groups (attempting to kill manhack while everyone is running around)\\n-Noisy\\n\\n  Gasoline/Match  \\nThis was origanlly supposed to be a flamethrower, but I think it would be too overpowered. I suppose it would also be easier to make a flamethrower. Pour gasoline on the ground to create temporary \\"walls\\" of fire when ignited. The gasoline would be visible to everyone so if you don\'t ignite it quickly people will avoid it. When I picture this I think of clue, and someone getting killed by a traitor as a ton of innocents walk up the stairs and see him die. Then the traitor ignites the gasoline and blocks the hallway. While the innocents wait and shoot through the flames the T enters the painting to the hidden tunnels and is never seen again.\\n+Blocks hallways for traitors to make their getaway.\\n+Can be used to trap innocents for traitors to pick off, throw a grenade or wait for a C4 to go off.\\n+Anyone can just walk through it with the risk of getting slightly damaged.\\n-May lead to camping for short periods.\\n\\n  Headcrab Canister Airtsrike  \\nThis will send headcrabs from above! Only one canister can be shot and it has to be used in a open area, It will not work indoors at all. It will have a very small splash damage when it lands, when I tested it I would only die if I was directly under it. It then spawns a few headcrabs.\\n+Clears a large area.\\n+Nearly undetectable.\\n-Headcrabs will attack anyone on sight."},{"postId":10235,"topicId":1078,"posterId":4,"postTime":1288383422,"postText":"1) IDK, personally i fucking hate manhacks.\\n2) Awesome idea, however i think somebody already made this, i saw it in the toybox\\n3) I like this idea too, but i would have to try it out first"},{"postId":10245,"topicId":1078,"posterId":152,"postTime":1288391149,"postText":">> 1) IDK, personally i fucking hate manhacks.\\n2) Awesome idea, however i think somebody already made this, i saw it in the toybox\\n3) I like this idea too, but i would have to try it out first \\nI\'ve already made the manhack remote, but it sounds somewhat gameplay unbalancing."},{"postId":10250,"topicId":1078,"posterId":101,"postTime":1288394716,"postText":"1. How about a manhack that locks on to people, so if you die then it can still get a few kills. Increase health from normal one so they dont die in like half a second and waste a credit. And aren\'t the traitors SUPPOSED to try and get innocents to shoot other innocents?\\n\\n2. Yeah, kind of do like this, but how about you ignite it through a console command/traitor C menu which you can ignite from far away, as if you had to walk up next to it everyone would know it was you. Also, increase the damage of fire for this, as you CAN see the gasoline on the ground.\\n\\n3.
