Not to mention that ban was expired a few days ago. I however was told later (because I always forget that) Jail isn\'t with the banning page. He deserved the ban, though I forgot to ban him on Jail.\\n\\nEDIT: On a side note, he needs to get over the trivia incident. He is waaay too tunnel-visioned, as I didn\'t ban him for that, I banned him for the player disrespect AND the yelling at people over trivia. Not to mention he has VIP, it represents NNJG incredibly poorly. I say a removal of VIP would be a fine option to choose."},{"postId":37817,"topicId":4890,"posterId":916,"postTime":1321147126,"postText":"Didnt you Already Banned him?
