Everyone thinks otherwise cause they don\'t understand the concept of how big a map should be in relativity to the number of players. Peaches castle is great for 16-22 people. Its roughly the same overall size as Lost Temple. South Park would be a map good for 4-8 people if you wanna know what a reasonable size to player ratio is.\\n\\nI do agree that its too big if you have under 12 people tho, but even then most players camp outside anyway."},{"postId":28768,"topicId":3527,"posterId":735,"postTime":1313133224,"postText":"South park is good for 12-16 not 4-8.
