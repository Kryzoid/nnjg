How is saying one word a perma ban i find that is a little extreme and there was an admin on who did not slay the rdmer so how come i recived a punishment when the rdmer did not? I find this very unfair and request an unban because I dont see anything major about what I did. I belived the admin should have slayed me for saying this word \\"AssHole\\" but I always hear people using similar words and they dont recive bans. I realy like the sever but, I dont think saying\\" Asshole\\" should be a perma ban. Can any admins please respond to this unban request as fast as possabile.\\n\\n Edit: I know the rdmer was Flame and I think he was the admin who perma banned me."},{"postId":22242,"topicId":2762,"posterId":115,"postTime":1305770156,"postText":"Wrong section, buddy. \\n\\nScroll down to the bottom, click on ban requests.
