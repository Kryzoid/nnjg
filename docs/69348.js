List of what happened:\\n\\n1) I kill him for pushing me off a tall building that would have damaged me if I didn\'t have max grav upgrades.\\n2) Next round he shoots at me from a tall building (directly next to me so id shoot back). After he spams the (name) is a traitor macro trying to get me killed.\\n3) Round after he shoots around my feet baiting even more, i kill him and this time he shoots back.\\n4) He traps me in a room on the next map with a prop. If it wasn\'t for traitor ally killing him nothing would have been done.\\n5) He attempts to push me into the Temple traitor room with barrel, so i kill him again.\\n\\nEach time he got a warning to stop trying to troll, random accuse, or RDM. Pharaoh and Quack were there for the first 4. Flame was on later for the 5th happening. Flame also bore witness to the 5th troll/rdm attempt.\\n\\nOther things that Pharaoh witnessed him do but not me personally: (few other things people been saying he\'s done)\\n\\n1) Changed the player model of himself.\\n2) Changed player model of someone else on accident and didn\'t return it to the correct player model.\\n3) Brought himself back to life on several occasions.\\n\\nFrom what i can tell, all he has is VIP but somehow can do all this other crap. So from personal belief and knowing a bit about programming and coding. I would request that the anti-cheat thing be removed since it could have code to give him powers he should not have. (this is unless Gash has lied to everyone about what he can and can not do) Double check ALL of the coding/programming in his Anti-Cheat thing if he should not have these powers.\\n\\nThis ban request is for a perma-ban and demotion if nothing else based on abuse of power and constant troll/rdm/baiting with warnings on each and every attempt. As said before i do not have any personal screen shots of all of this but i have Admins as witness to every attempt of trolling/baiting/RDM."},{"postId":22602,"topicId":2810,"posterId":760,"postTime":1306196924,"postText":">> \\n1) Changed the player model of himself.\\n2) Changed player model of someone else on accident and didn\'t return it to the correct player model.\\n3) Brought himself back to life on several occasions.\\n \\n1) Wow changing my playermodel to alyx for one round, that completely ruins everyones experience!\\n2) I did change it back within 10 seconds\\n3) You were not involved with this at all, and it was on one occasion, but throughout the round, I just hid in part of the map."},{"postId":22603,"topicId":2810,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306197160,"postText":"Talking with Pharaoh and the others to confirm what happened for these 5 attempts.\\n\\nAlso, admitting to doing it doesn\'t help your case when your trying to say your not abusing.

Three of the times were little more than mere bullshit (ranging from pushing crisis with a barrel \\"attempting\\" to rdm him) to shooting near him (yeah, traitorbaiting, he was slayed for it). More of an overreaction to those times, yes. they all resulted with YOU (or in one case, your traitor buddy) killing him then YOU getting him slayed.\\n\\nHim pushing you off the building would show up in the damagelogs as well, but I do not recall this part, and you don\'t have proof for that.\\n\\nAlso, I never ONCE heard you ask him to stop doing what hes doing, you just kill him. Then you say he\'s trolling. No warnings. You never asked him to stop doing what hes doing, and you simply asked for a slay for that situation when it could have easily been diffused if you just asked him to stop.\\n\\nThe \\"privilages\\" he has are being discussed and will be handled by the admins, and SHOULDN\'T be included in the ban request,and will be handled properly. \\n\\nOn top of all of that, he was banned for a day. To be honest, the only thing he SHOULD be perma\'d for would be his \\"privilages\\" and that won\'t be decided by this thread.

The pushing thing would of done dmg if i didn\'t have max upgrades (hence why i killed him). After the 3rd warning he got to stop trying to troll, i decided that warning him to stop wouldn\'t overall stop him and decided that its best just to kill him on sight for non-stop doing it. The abuse thing was just brought up since like some i don\'t like abuse overall the way i have heard.\\n\\nI do admit that i might have been partly wrong to just straight up kill him for maybe 1 of the things he did. Only time i actually killed him for little was prop pushing on Temple. The first time was pushing me off a building (regardless of dmg its traitorous), second time was shooting at me (would have hit if i didn\'t move), and the third time was for same reason (traitor baiting by shooting near my feet).\\n\\nAlso, the abuse thing i mentioned a way he could have gotten the powers if Gash didn\'t give them. Was mainly just a helping hand on something which most people think isn\'t possible."},{"postId":22615,"topicId":2810,"posterId":115,"postTime":1306200680,"postText":"Everything you stated there pretty much justifies a 1 day ban or so. Which he was already banned for. Basically pushing you off of that building didnt damage you, and you killed him for it. Justified, in my opinion.\\n\\nFrom what you said, you negated a good 2 or 3 out of the 5 reasons, leaving only 2/3 trolling/mingebag things (previously stated, has already been dealt with).\\n\\nTherefore the only thing that would really matter in this ban request is the eyewitness accounts of him using his special \\"privilages\\". Those would be dealth with by the administrators, as previously stated."},{"postId":22616,"topicId":2810,"posterId":760,"postTime":1306201033,"postText":"I must also add in, you seem to get grudges on people really easy or something, because the moment you came into the server, you had a problem with me. You\'ve made at least 20 ban requests in the last 3 pages. Some of these people are not even faulty of anything ban worthy, just one accidental rdm or so."},{"postId":22617,"topicId":2810,"posterId":79,"postTime":1306201517,"postText":"Only person ive ever had a grudge with is Mark/Nez/Zerb. I dont get grudges easily and i follow the rules pretty strictly as most will admit. Almost all of my ban requests got accepted with the proof given, the only few that weren\'t accepted was when rdm happened while i was traitor (understandable since you cant know its rdm unless under 10 seconds into round + u didn\'t do anything all round). The reason most my ban requests got accepted is because i post ban requests when people are obviously in the wrong.\\n\\nWhen i get upset i settle it on the server asking mod+ to slay/do something about it. A lot of people that have done things i havnt posted requests on because it was a minor thing or they havnt done this stuff often. (shit happens now and then). In your case, 5 rounds in a row while i was on this happened and you want to say i have a grudge. I understand you say 1 day ban is enough, but imo and from how things used to be (still not used to the leniency of the mods+ now) the ban should have been a week at the very least.\\n\\nI let the Mods+ do what they see fit as long as they do something about it. You want to say i have grudges against normal players/new players like you, ive even posted requests on a few admins and asked them specifically if they would just resign since they are too lenient/dont want to ban anymore.\\n\\nI can 100% assure you this ban request was not made through a grudge. If you think it was so be it, but in that thought method, all ban requests would be grudges."},{"postId":22629,"topicId":2810,"posterId":389,"postTime":1306203861,"postText":">> ive even posted requests on a few admins and asked them specifically if they would just resign since they are too lenient/dont want to ban anymore. \\n\\nAm at that point yet?
