Reappearing/dissapearing blocks occur at least 75% of the time I try to do anything, and the lag is horrible. If this new host is costing you more money I would advise going back to the old one, where the only time I think anyone lagged was when the server was saving or they were on a bad computer. \\n\\nMaybe I\'m just being judgmental too soon, but yeah... so far noooot too good.\\n\\n[Edit] Okay it\'s not quite as bad after playing for an hour or so.
