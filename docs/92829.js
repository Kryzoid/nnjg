It is great fun, great physics, AND A GIANT RIDABLE WOLF. The demo is amazing, it starts out as a typical side-shooter, then you get a wolf, AND THE AMAZING BOSS FIGHTS \\n\\n SPOILERS (highlight to see, unless you are some wizard, then you can see it.) \\n THE BOSS, YOU ARE RUNNING BACKWARDS AS IT DESTROYS THE GROUND INFRONT OF YOU, so oool. THEN YOU RIDE ITS ARMOR DOWN A HILL WHILE FIGHTING SNOWBOARDING NINJAS AND COLOSSAL ROBOT SNAKES! \\n\\nThis will be a great game once it is released, a definite buy for me."}]}')}}]);
