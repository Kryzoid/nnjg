He may make a lot of ban requests, but if the ban requests work out, whats the need to make him moderator? Just because crisis made a lot of ban requests doesnt mean he will get mod.\\n\\nON A SIDE NOTE, I seriously think we need to demote or warn some of our current administration. A fair amount of people have been lacking activity throughout the summer and it has shown. In fact, I have gotten complaints that the administration was not on enough to deal with things, and some of the regulars only saw 1-3 different admins on throughout the day. \\n\\nThe solution to our problem isnt to add more members to the administration, it\'s to add AND ALSO replace some of the less active members of the administration.\\n\\nOn another side note, we don\'t have a moderator class, just an admin class and an owner class"},{"postId":31025,"topicId":3771,"posterId":153,"postTime":1314489940,"postText":"I\'m trying to get Udane back.\\nGash, I need to talk to you about the fact that every time I go away, and you talk to Udane, he leaves.
