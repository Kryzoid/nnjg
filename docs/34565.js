I also didn\'t get any kills or damage anyone that round, nor did I even shoot my gun but I\'m not able to prove that. I also saw he was getting banned for speedhacking, and someone told me he was already getting banned for rdming after the round ended where he killed me. So he may have been rdming because he knew he was getting banned I\'m not 100% sure though.\\n5) Were any specific server rules broken: RDM\\n6) Any staff members on the server at the time of the offence: None.\\n7) Proof:  http://i41.tinypic.com/2vbouol.png "},{"postId":37355,"topicId":4822,"posterId":84,"postTime":1320623438,"postText":"CuttingEdge has been banned already for a number of offenses before this request, do not worry."}]}')}}]);
