After asking him 5 times he finally responds saying that the innocent he killed was due to crossfire of him killing the traitor. I asked him then how he knew he was a traitor, in which he said that he had shot someone. Looking at damage logs, the traitor he had killed had done absolutely no damage to anyone that round, and there was no DNA sample also. It must have been due to some hack that he knew, or just blatant RDM.\\nAdmins on?:Nope.\\nProof?:\\n http://i56.tinypic.com/2qjfuqv.jpg \\n http://i55.tinypic.com/2mdvu9.jpg \\n http://i53.tinypic.com/2lo6as3.jpg \\n http://i55.tinypic.com/whe8zl.jpg \\n http://i51.tinypic.com/2wguc6a.jpg "},{"postId":29831,"topicId":3680,"posterId":84,"postTime":1313718760,"postText":"Banned and Locked"}]}')}}]);
