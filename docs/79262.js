The biggest difference is that this map will focus soley on the randomized rooms, and in addition, these rooms will be mostly made by the community. Also, to probably everyones joy, it will be smaller.\\nHere\'s how it works. I have a link to a small template map, all you gotta do is fill it in and follow the rules of the map creation. I will provide a screenshot of what the temp file looks like at the end of the post. Link to file: http://www.mediafire.com/file/mkykm79vrngy5lm/temps.zip\\n\\n Rule 1 : You will only be allowed to use func_brush for your walls and floors, nothing else should be added. This is to ensure quick clean randomization (this includes no props, entities, other forms of walls, triggers, etc) . The bottom floor is already provided for you, you should not make it, but the floors for the 2nd and 3rd floor need to be made.\\n Rule 2 : You must make sure there is a path to each and every orange sqaure on the map. The reason here is so that the weapons will spawn in the same location, without causing any possible weapons being stuck inside walls and causing massive lag. These orange squares should not be covered up by the floor you make.\\n Rule 3 : The dark grey walls, roof, and ceiling are all part of your bounding box. Your zone must stay inside of it. The orange walls are where the walkways to different areas will be.\\n Rule 4 : The default zone will not have a top roof, ergo, if you want your zone to have a roof, make it yourself (but to be sure its in your head, the bottom floor will already be made, dont make it.)\\n Rule 5 : When you finish your zone, you will then post it onto this site using an easy file sharing site, ie mediafire (unless the attachment thingy works, which I dont trust). Preferably with a screenshot or two (Screenshots not required.) The name of the file you upload will be considered the room\'s name. Please also post your preferred name. The reason for this is when your room spawns, It will state its name and your preferred name.\\n Rule 6 : You will notice a small grey band around the floor, this is to show you the height of the optional water for your area. If you want water for your zone, be sure to include a \\"please add water\\" or \\"this requires water\\" in your post.\\n Rule 7 : There is a 5 zone limit per person, and a 20 zone limit for the map. This means if I recieve/make too many combined, some may have to be scrapped/saved for another time. The decision will be based on order posted.\\n Rule 8 : You must post all the zones you want in the map before July 1st. [Please, oh please, dont expect me to be able to 100% put everything together in one day, it all depends on the zones everyone places in]\\n Optional Rule 9 : If you select the boundary box, you will notice its in its own group. I\'d like it if you made your zone, excluding the boundary box, one large func_brush. This way it will end up being easier on me to fix it into the large map.\\n Optional Rule 10 : Please make your zone different textures then the boundary box. Also including your two fave colors will determine the floor and wall colors. New textures may need to be created for some requests of colors, but it will be done.\\n\\n Note : The textures used here are only to help assist the creation of the zones, the final textures will be similar to the ones in ttt_confused_creation... but they will not be made of glass.\\n Note : If too many people request water in their zone, only the zones of which the water is needed for quick jumps down or the likes will have water. If too many zones require water, some may be dropped.\\n\\n Tip : If you want more then one way up instead of the ladders, feel free to make custom stairs out of func_brushes.\\n Tip : The highst set of orange squares, aka the third floor, could very well be your roof if you wish it to be. Doing this will enable players to aim from one zone to another.\\n Tip : Including holes in the wall, aka windows, will have that zone have a higher priority to being included.\\n Tip : Try to make sure there is at least room enough for two people to go through any given hallway at any time.\\n\\nEdit1* Feel free to make any other comments on this topic about this topic, Yall dont have to only place map files here.\\nEdit2* If you have any other questions, pm me or add me or something XD\\nEdit3* Changed the download file to include both .vmx and .vmf\\nEdit4* The July 1st date it the final deadline before I do the rest myself... If I get enough submissions faster then that, then the actual map can start alot sooner. /forgot to mention that\\nEdit5* Adding a zone counter to help me keep track of open and close range zones. This post may be edited quite a lot.\\n\\nHappy creating!\\n\\n http://i309.photobucket.com/albums/kk373/cyoungz/temp.jpg \\n\\nClose zones: 0\\nMiddle zones: 1\\nOpen zones: 1"},{"postId":23789,"topicId":2989,"posterId":634,"postTime":1307849063,"postText":"Freaking awesome idea!
