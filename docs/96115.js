I know that Admins and Mods have the ability to see their RP names next to their Steam user id, so they can quickly slap, kick, or ban whoever needs to be dealt with. I, as a VIP, on the other hand, have to go about and slap every single prisoner for 0 damage until i find the one causing the commotion. By then, everyone is either dead, the round is over and he gets a new rp name, or something else of that category. I just believe in my opinion it would be extremely helpful to have the ability to pop open my list and easily just slap someone, or votekick, rather than go through everyone before i can get the job done. Please take this thought into consideration. Thanks.\\n\\n-nicholsml, AKA Rainbow Dash"}]}')}}]);
