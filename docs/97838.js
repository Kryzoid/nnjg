He makes claims of what people deserve and don\'t deserve. I understand he\'s nnjg, but i dont understand how is normal additude is allowed, he always does things like this from what i heard."},{"postId":4110,"topicId":440,"posterId":54,"postTime":1278920885,"postText":"On top of things, aren\'t we Crisis?\\n\\nAnyways, yes I killed you on purpose. My reason is you\'re a horrible MOD, you don\'t deserve it. And this doesn\'t differ to what you said to gash. I\'ll paste that in a minute. Crisis, you mute people for no reason, you NEVER unmute them. And you\'re a bad MOD all-in-all. You just think you are the master around, and I don\'t see WHY you have ban. Even Cake agrees with me on this topic, you\'re to harsh. In fact, we were just talking about this, Cake and I. You ban people for killing ONLY you. You revenge kill too, which brings me to this:\\n\\n\\n๖.\\\\\\\\Shadow}: 12:05 AM - __Crisis: k, well i know that now.

Crisis, you\'re a raging kid who does not deserve MOD, you abuse it cause you got it for nothing. You think it\'s all alright when you do shit, it\'s not.

You\'re mad I killed you."},{"postId":4113,"topicId":440,"posterId":6,"postTime":1278921787,"postText":"Saying it now, it sounds more like YOUR raging Crazy Monkey, Crisis didnt say anything or rage after you got day banned, it sounds like YOUR raging."},{"postId":4114,"topicId":440,"posterId":26,"postTime":1278922066,"postText":">> \\nI agree that Crisis can be abusive at times, but i agree with Crisis, you have rdmed and revenged alot since you got unbanned, and just because your friends with me and Cake  wont let you get away with it. \\n \\n\\nThis apparently happens with misfit, Though"},{"postId":4115,"topicId":440,"posterId":79,"postTime":1278922584,"postText":"I admit i typed that, but u typed those private messages over chat for everyone to see and from what i see it\'s not the first time.
