You are not allowed to kill someone for destroying a prop unless that prop is needed in a traitor tester, in which case destroying it means no testing. You claimed a room via this option and should be punished accordingly. You also just lied in a post and under the forum rules you are not to lie about something like this. (misconceptions are different stories) Overall you lied about what you did, you claimed a room, and you rdm\'d. 3 serious rules broken.\\n\\n(pardon post)"},{"postId":31966,"topicId":3959,"posterId":84,"postTime":1315086393,"postText":"He has had his ban extended.
