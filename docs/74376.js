Its an emp that would power down any electrical devices that are not traitors such as the weapon scanner, flashlights , health stations, etc. This would make things even so that the weapon scanner is not so overpowered. The emp as i said sounds like a jihad boom and looks like c4 but only has 1 use in whatever radius it could take 30 seconds to plant and make everything power down up to 5 minutes? This idea would be revolutionary to the ttt games just like the additional weapons and weapon scanner"},{"postId":2293,"topicId":219,"posterId":12,"postTime":1275857315,"postText":"interesting... thoguhts everyone?"},{"postId":2305,"topicId":219,"posterId":39,"postTime":1275861666,"postText":"I like it"},{"postId":2316,"topicId":219,"posterId":48,"postTime":1275872731,"postText":">> \\ninteresting... thoguhts everyone?\\n \\n\\nI also think it sounds pretty cool.
