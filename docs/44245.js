Now this Udane guy comes in and thinks hes top guy around. He called himself Mod of Mods and cleans up everything. No he doesnt he makes the server boring adn no fun at all. Ask Neo Chopper Balenti, etc. I just want to be unbanned.\\n\\n\\nMark: what did he do\\nUdane: knife a T, killed another T, trolled\\nUdane: and left after it all\\n\\nHe lied to Mark^^ btw, I killed one T as T on accident because i tried to knife a guy but missed and hit my buddy so i kill myself and apolagize to him. He says \\"Oh you killed me? Lol i thought i got slayed\\" Me: \\"No i killed you on accident sorry\\" Him: \\"Its ok i know it was on accident\\". And i did no \\"trolling\\" or leave, Disconnect: You\'re banned from this server for 1minute. Reason:..., Thats what he called me \\"leaving\\" even though he banned me then i try to come back a minute later and it says Disconnect: You\'re permabanned on this server, reason: . .\\nI have screenshots of it all. He should not have any power at all and if u guys dont take away his power atleast unban me"},{"postId":23986,"topicId":3017,"posterId":4,"postTime":1308032371,"postText":"Please follow the template.\\nhttp://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1946"},{"postId":23987,"topicId":3017,"posterId":605,"postTime":1308032814,"postText":"No reason? You came in with a different name, rdmed two Ts as a T, and were trolling. Before this, you\'ve been trolling quite often over the mic, with a few problems here n there.\\nEveryone knows, I think im just the backup, the mod who does work when no one is on. I never once mentioned that im the best, or the mod of mods. Please do not place words in my mouth that I do not own, it only makes you look worse.\\nEven if the case I make the server more boring, there\'s less rdm. But you can ask just about anyone that actually plays the server, and they would disagree with you.\\n\\nYou edited the statement that I sent to mark, I told him that I mistakenly said that you left. The next round after you did the rdm, I asked you what had occured. I was off already banning another man, so if this chat of yours occured, I missed it while banning another man. In this case, you should have still told me what occured when I questioned you.\\nIf your T buddy comes on and confirms it was an accident, then I would retract this part, even though you did not tell me directly. But I will not retract my trolling part of the ban. This being said, the ban time should be severly less in this case.\\n\\nI dont care if your a regular, if you break the rules, I will do something about it.\\n\\n*Edited after he edited his post"},{"postId":23988,"topicId":3017,"posterId":316,"postTime":1308033395,"postText":"xD Udane that was probly the funniest thing ive read, considering I have proof your full of shit.

The may we use to hate Mark before he started loosening up and becoming fun to play with. Your ways of playing are stupid and boring. The rdm in your eyes is oh u cause anyone damage and your slayed/kicked/banned. Thats dumb because as friends we like to mess with each other ( No Homo xD) well i mean you have no friends so i guess you dont know what its like"},{"postId":23991,"topicId":3017,"posterId":316,"postTime":1308033691,"postText":"the singing or humming annoyed the other players?

I mean really dude, aint that bannable in its own right?\\nI understand rdm for friends is fun, but you have to tell me you rdmed for fun when I ask what happened, otherwise I have no choice but to assume you just wanted to grief. This is why I wont slay if the person who was rdmed says its ok.\\nYou may want to clam down before you keep posting.\\n\\nAsk Balenti, if he does it too much, I gag him as well... He really should set a better example for the server. But no, I dont gag because im annoyed, I gag when it appears people would not have a chance to talk because of said signing or such."},{"postId":23993,"topicId":3017,"posterId":316,"postTime":1308034030,"postText":"You edited the statement that I sent to mark, I told him that I mistakenly said that you left.

Would have been all I needed. I am deeply sorry for perma banning you, and only wish you could understand my position in this. It appeared to be a random join in to a rdm, and no response to a query about it. So I apologize.\\nAlso, I understand why you were making this post into an attack on me at first. It must have appeared to be a very random ban.\\nI only request that if I request information, to not ignore me, as ive stated, I had to go with what I know, and that alone. In this case, it caused something very wrong.\\nThis being said, I will hold up with the my belief you are indeed a troll, but that does not warrant a perma ban. With the amount you did, it would probably only be worth at the extreme of an hour.\\nI will be giving you points if you accept them next time I see you, as an apology. As this is the only way I know of to even be able to give something back.\\nSadly, I myself cant unban or edit bans, so we must wait."},{"postId":24308,"topicId":3017,"posterId":316,"postTime":1308385358,"postText":"Thank you"},{"postId":24328,"topicId":3017,"posterId":2,"postTime":1308432984,"postText":"I believe I unbanned you a couple days ago.
