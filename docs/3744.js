I neglected to double check it and went off to ban on easy ban. This caused Destar to be banned falsely. Once I found this out, I quickly apologized to him, I honestly felt terrible that I actually falsely banned someone. I offered him 250 points to make up for this error and he declined. Thankfully Gash came on not too long after and unbanned him. Shortly after I once again offered to give him 250 points, or some form of compensation. He once again declined.\\nSince then I\'ve been triple checking everything.\\nThe reason I post this is not only to reveal my mistake, but to show off Destar\'s humility."},{"postId":23791,"topicId":2990,"posterId":634,"postTime":1307850105,"postText":"BOW DOWN TO MY HUMBLENESS!"},{"postId":23812,"topicId":2990,"posterId":115,"postTime":1307886324,"postText":"The player was still in-game.

Using it while a rulebreaker is still on the server is just plain stupid.\\n\\nHonestly, I saw no reason for you to ban him through easyban.

Why would you have bothered to even ban him on easyban when you could\'ve just typed \\"ulx ban name time reason\\" \\nEver get tired of explaning each and every ban (in clear detail) that you do in a server to everyone not involved?\\nIe. 5 Players complain about a dude rdming, after checking damagelog, it appears he has. After further questioning him in text chat, and over the mic, it has been confirmed, so a ban is in order (in this example, this is his second/third offense in a row). Once the ban is completed, everyone in the server tends to go on about why the dude was banned, and some claim they saw him do nothing.\\n\\nIt depends on the severity of the ban for me. I dont feel like explaining each ban that most people don\'t witness themselves, but ones where its beyond obvious the dude is a troll both on the mic/text chat, and in the game... those I ban right then and there, to get them out before they cause more damage.\\nThis being said, neo\'s easy ban was so far the only easy ban I did with the dude still in game. Luckily everyone else that ive banned on easyban left shortly after their offense so I don\'t have to explain in explicit detail their crimes to everyone.\\n\\nIt\'s not that I don\'t want people out of the loop, it just gets hard to explain everything when everyone is on the mic at once (if you have not met me from before I used my mic, youd know my typing sucks). If I\'m asked at one point, i\'ll still attempt to explain."},{"postId":23855,"topicId":2990,"posterId":115,"postTime":1307918622,"postText":"You don\'t NEED to explain it to everyone, nevermind explain it in detail.

Not that I\'d easy ban everyone. \\nActually while we are here. I\'m just a backup moderator, I\'m only supposed to be doing work as long as other mods/admins are not on or doing anything. In other words, if you weren\'t so lazy and got on more often, I would not be the one required to ban most everyone that has been banned lately.\\n\\n>> Then maybe you\'re not suited to be moderator. If you can\'t take people asking you such questions for WHATEVER reason, then you definately have something to work out. \\nMy job is purely backup mod, and keeping an eye on who actually does their job or not. I highly doubt you\'re one to be online 12 hours a day. On a side note, I feel as though this would be considered an attack on myself.\\n\\n>> And what do you mean \\"ever get tired of\\"?

You make it sound like this is the very first time in my life I have ever done any form of adminerstration. It is you young one, who does not know what it\'s like to be a full time mod/admin.
