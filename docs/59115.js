I know Ch. and player knows Ch. I belive he did not mean to harm the server or the game at anytime, and it was just a misunderstanding. Also, a week 3 days and 40min seems a bit much for a small offense that has not very much proof. \\nDon\'t post in unban requests unrelated to you.

( I was now stuck on what to do about this ban) \\nI did respond and explained to you what happened, I don\'t understand why you think I didn\'t since I already denied you in steamchat :/ \\nI unfriended you because I thought we were done with the matter after I told you that I wouldn\'t shorten your ban request. Besides you didn\'t respond after that as I recall"}]}')}}]);
