Personally, i am a HUGE fan of the series, and have no doubt that this will manage to top the previous chapters. From what I have seen so far, the new engine looks great, the new animations look fantastic, and the gameplay looks excellent. The storyline will surely be a fantastically deep and heroic plot, and all in all, this game looks awesome.

I THINK I beat the main questline? I go to some dream world to slay Alduin the World-Eater. I have to say, the ending didn\'t have a heart-felt dramatic ending like fallout 3 or even Oblivion, but the boss fight was still pretty tough. I lived through with 1 hit remaining before I would have died. There wasn\'t really anything very special I got out of defeating the final boss, though? I figured I would have gotten some \\"SUPER HAXORZ SWORD FTW\\" or something. \\n\\nI discovered an easter egg that you may have known about. If you travel to the Throat of the world (The very top) and go to the peak of the mountain, you will find multiple ebony ores, and some others. Im like, oh no! i don\'t have a pickaxe! then there is one lodged in the rock. The \\"notched pickaxe\\" As they call it. Hmm, reference? (Its super special)\\n\\nThis game seems much harder than previous ones, despite what critics say with \\"Dumbing it down\\". You definitely need strategy to just survive in this game. Sadly, I had to tone down my difficulty in some spots because I pushed through the main quest and hardly did any side quests, so the creatures were way too tough for me.\\n\\nAbout that guy in the north that leads you to that dungeon, that dungeon is a BITCH. It\'s long as balls and prepare to meet some centurions to fight. Mainly consists of Draugrs, but once you get further down, you meet the dwarven spiders, centurions, etc. The highlight of the dungeon i believe is when you get to the super duper underground zone. Its like an underground settlement, if you will. You will locate Special Ninroot down here, so make sure to grab it all and do that quest later. \\nThe guy who leads you to the dungeon is actually a part of the Main storyline. If I were you, I would wait for you to reach that point. (He helps you find an elder scroll, but theres a sidequest as well.) \\n\\nIn the underground cave, theres a house directly in front of you, that I recommend going inside. If you are low on potions or need to enchant some new dwarven gear, theres an enchanting table, and a alchemy table. It made me mad though, because I got a bug when enchanting the first time that made me unable to rename, then unable to exit the menus. Then I couldnt access my start menu, and had to exit skyrim. THEN, skyrim wouldn\'t open, so I had to restart my PC, because steam wouldn\'t close. Phew. But now it works all well :) Theres some special nirnroot and a book and potions in there too.\\n\\nHmm, after completing the main quest, there seems to be even MORE dragons around. xD\\n\\nLately Ive been messing with the console command: setscale (any #, 1 is default)  when selecting a creature. They get either HUGE or small, and they act pretty silly when large. I do this in the tundra just for kicks. xD\\n\\nOh yea, and I\'ve stumbled across werewolf form from doing some \\"Stuff\\", but how do you come across it in the first place?

It especially helps if you have the Black Star, which is a reusable soul gem that can capture human souls (which are the largest.  Dunnno if it can capture smaller ones).  Random iron dagger with okay fire enchantment (Only had like 40 enchanting and 2 enchanting perks, it gets better the higher your level and the more perks that you have corresponding to it) + human soul = something over 600 septims if I remember correctly.  Obviously it won\'t sell for that much unless you have high speech, but it still is a huge improvement and very easy to do.  I\'m going to raise my enchanting up a ton, turns out if you give all 4 pieces of armor an enchantment related to a specific school of magic (like destruction, restoration, etc) and have high enough enchanting and perks, you can cast that type of magic  for free .

The higher the stage of the disease, the more it sucks.  Can\'t regenerate health, stamina, or magicka naturally outside (good luck running anywhere), people might attack you, and other things.  Sure it has upsides, but overall it\'s probably not worth it.  So yes, Balenti is right.  For once.\\n\\nNow, for whatever reason there seems to be no downsides to being a werewolf, unless someone sees you transform.  But assuming no one does, you can go on random crime sprees and murder people you want dead and run off and transform back and no one will blame you for it.  Or you can just use it to beat down on tough enemies.  I\'m going to do it shortly, and I\'m talking Aela as  my waifu  my companion too >:D\\nAlso, as soon as I hit 100 smithing and enchanting, I am going to make dragonscale armor and enchant it with the souls of those I feel like, including my first companion I had, Faendal.

So that way i can murder people without consequences! \\nBasically the best use of it.  Although it gets annoying when people attack you when you\'re only trying to kill one person.  I have to run away so I don\'t accidentally swat any old ladies like last time.  Stupid old hag came after me with a dagger and caught a backhand while I was going for a guard.  One time I got attacked by hunters who had been bathing, so they didn\'t even put on their armor before charging the werewolf fighting a dragon.  Geniuses.\\nAlso, don\'t play with console commands.  There are some things man was not meant to do.  I shouldn\'t have played God ."},{"postId":38175,"topicId":4561,"posterId":292,"postTime":1321823425,"postText":"Anyone else find a random ghost Headless Horseman travelling the roads on his ghostly horse? I couldn\'t talk to him but when I killed a wolf near him he said \\"Finality.\\" Other than that I haven\'t discovered much else about him. Google says that he leads you to some place with a chest with a master lock and some enemies, as well as a graveyard with a gravestone that has only a skull and an axe identical to the one he\'s carrying.
