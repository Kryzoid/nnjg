Cake, I\'m sorry for the way I acted that day when I tried to get you demoted. I\'m stupid. I don\'t want to lose a hell of a friend over a game. We\'ve been best friends for 3-4 years. I don\'t want all that to end. You are a great friend, and I don\'t want to lose that. I did what I did out of rage. Please, forgive me. I made you something.

I really don\'t want shit to go down like this. All the good times we had. All ended over a game? I don\'t think this is how it should go down. Please, I\'m sorry. This isn\'t how it should go, a game shouldn\'t split apart two friends like this. We\'ve been friends for years, and now it\'s going to jeopardize our friendship like this.

I told you the first time you unreasonably tried to report me and get my position taken away for bullshit, that you need to understand something, my place as admin and future growth, was more important than my friendship with you if you are gonna continue to be the way you are. You have been nothing but a hemorrhage to me while on the server, ever time I get on you say you are gonna cry to the admins about me not \\"doing stuff I am supposed to be doing\\" or \\"abusing\\". You have done it on many occasions, and they all know how you are so I don\'t get in trouble, but really it looks bad on me that you won\'t shut up about it. Since they won\'t remove you from server, even with all the stuff you do to me (constant disrespect to an admin) and the fact I am called daily about you trolling, and chronically rdmin, my way to deal with you was completely ignore so you wouldn\'t cause me any more problems. Since however you are bringing the server down because of it, and bringing out my personal life to the forum, the only option I see, since none of them will approve getting rid of you, is me getting rid of myself. This is too far, since you continue to cause the place I love so much problems, the only way I can fix it is by leaving, no matter how much it will hurt me."},{"postId":3849,"topicId":400,"posterId":6,"postTime":1277770020,"postText":"It doesn\'t have to end that way, why can\'t you two both stay and become friends again?
