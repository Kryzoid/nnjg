This actually happened to me earlier today. I was following someone because I thought they were probably a traitor and was waiting for them to do something traitorous.

You are traitor as well.\\n\\n2) If you think he\'s the traitor. Why the hell you sticking close to him.\\n\\nIf someone kills traitor and your sitting next to him not shooting him at all.

Plus Some people hand out withh innocents as traitor to troll.\\n2 - It\'s If they don\'t know hes traitor.  He might think he\'s innocent.\\nIf the are with eachother for a minute and you seen them together and that they were together its ok, but its not ok to kill the traitor, and then kill the guy right behind him for being near him for probably no more than 5 seconds."},{"postId":19999,"topicId":2503,"posterId":272,"postTime":1304076950,"postText":">> 2 things about this which is why i dont agree with any of those.\\n\\n1) Almost 100% the time if your sitting in a room with traitor, and he\'s not shooting you.

If I\'m traitor, I will often hang out with an innocent until he deems me trustworthy. \\nFor 2, easy answer. We\'re waiting for him to make a move, then get two points.\\nFor your final one, how often do you kill someone next to a traitor and they turn out to be inno?
