When you enter a battle, you are taken to a smaller map with terrain fitting wherever you are on the world map. The battles are fought in real-time.\\nI also greatly dislike multiplayer. The people who actually know how to \\"fight\\" online (and have better connections) always win against inexperienced players with bad connections (like me).\\nMount and Blade Warband has a LOT of replay value, especially if you go find the cheats. Building a 200-man army before you finish the first quest is always fun. :3"},{"postId":18378,"topicId":2261,"posterId":636,"postTime":1301859529,"postText":"im good and bad at strategy games at the same time i lost 14 battles in a row on total war shogun but then made a comeback and won 7 in a row."},{"postId":18431,"topicId":2261,"posterId":521,"postTime":1301911940,"postText":"Its not like total war ones, its FPS but your troops automatically charge until archers get in range.

Usually dont have cavalry."},{"postId":18541,"topicId":2261,"posterId":364,"postTime":1302104817,"postText":"Shogun is alright... but spawning troops to make any army is a pain. But back to M&B, what stratagy are you talking about? I led a 150-ish man army agains a 400-ish man army and won with no cheats or commands. Hell, I even led an 240-ish man army on a attack on a 980-ish man army and won. Note that I did have to use the health cheat like a pussy. But considing I lost only about 140-ish troops, I did alright. Wound treatment saves my ass, and breaks any palyability in that game... as long as troops are not attacked by the King/Nobles they will pretty much live even after falling off a cliff. A fall from some cliffs will add up to an amazing 800 some damage... but they just get wounded like its nothing."},{"postId":18553,"topicId":2261,"posterId":521,"postTime":1302122749,"postText":"I travel light, I once went on a campaign in sarranid area with 50 huscarls and 30 longbows or w/e nord top tier ones called.
