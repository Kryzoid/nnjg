(Remove that Ben/Gash or whoever controls the forums)\\n\\nIn case you were wondering, it went down because APPARENTLY they billed an extra 5 dollars I didn\'t know about, so they shut down the server and deleted my account. HOWEVER, it was my birthday yesterday, and I now have 140 dollars which I can spend on a new server (not to mention I\'ll probably get more tomorrow.) So, do you want me to put up a new TF2 server (and because I\'m going to use Xenon instead of counter-strike.com, I can get more slots... only 22 dollars for 24 slots rather than 20 dollars for 16 slots) or do you want me to put up a different kind of server?\\n\\n\\nSorry for the TF2 server issues."},{"postId":7914,"topicId":840,"posterId":82,"postTime":1284856848,"postText":"Black Ops ranked server pre-order 15.99 a month :D"},{"postId":7916,"topicId":840,"posterId":2,"postTime":1284858571,"postText":"Tf2 official maps."},{"postId":7919,"topicId":840,"posterId":101,"postTime":1284859148,"postText":"I had the idea of Surf on gmod XD"},{"postId":7921,"topicId":840,"posterId":4,"postTime":1284862420,"postText":"The best maps from each gamemode on TF2 in one rotation, but with a working votemap system at the end of each map time for the next map, and admins have the power to change the map still.\\n\\n24 slot\\nno respawn times\\nsemi-serious\\nrmf_mod"},{"postId":7923,"topicId":840,"posterId":6,"postTime":1284862934,"postText":">> The best maps from each gamemode on TF2 in one rotation, but with a working votemap system at the end of each map time for the next map, and admins have the power to change the map still.\\n\\n24 slot\\nno respawn times\\nsemi-serious\\nrmf_mod \\nThis."},{"postId":7926,"topicId":840,"posterId":101,"postTime":1284865608,"postText":"Yes, but you guys NEED to get on the server more often if I will put it to TF2.
