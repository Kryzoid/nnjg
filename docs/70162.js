Afterwards the Prisoner started ranting about how I\'m shooting him for no reason.  I\'m sure I was shooting the right Prisoner because it was just me and him in the cell. He started to attack me, so I shot him down. Then I got blacklisted from Guards for RDMing apparently. So I was wondering if I could be un-blacklisted from being a Guard. I have read the rules and I promise to abide to them. Why I was blacklisted might be a different reason. There are many other people who are Guards that are ten times more worst than me, and are not blacklisted for reasons that should be. So I was hoping if an Admin could read this request and possibly give me the chance to be un-blacklisted, or give me a time length for how long I am to be blacklisted. \\nAgain, I promise not to abuse the abilities of being a guard, and I would like to be given a chance to be un-blacklisted.\\nMy steam ID is\\nSTEAM_0:0:21142401\\n\\nThank you. "},{"postId":31222,"topicId":3843,"posterId":372,"postTime":1314578351,"postText":"Moved to Unban Requests.
