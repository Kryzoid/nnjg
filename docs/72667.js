The ban was neccisarry, but the length of the ban was unnessicary. I went two rounds, beginning with traitor, then was innocent second round.  I desided to crowbar hit someone off the edge into the water (That would kill him)  I desided  right after to kill myself.  I was banned the next round permanetly for ONLY killing ONE person.  I never left after killing him or anything else.
