I\'d recommend smaller icons, they take up less space so you can see more of your background image; also reduce startup time ever so slightly. (less pixels to load)\\n\\nFunnyraff: I really don\'t see the point of having huge ass icons on your desktop. I just find it looks cluttered and ugly. The icon theme is neat though. I\'d recommend changing the taskbar icons to small, so that you have more screen space in open windows. The default bar in windows 7 is hugeeeee compared to other versions.\\n\\nMine:\\n http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/722/desktopjdf.png "},{"postId":17798,"topicId":2191,"posterId":521,"postTime":1300965936,"postText":"How would you go about making your icons smaller on a x64bit vista home premium?"},{"postId":17822,"topicId":2191,"posterId":101,"postTime":1301007767,"postText":">> How would you go about making your icons smaller on a x64bit vista home premium? \\n\\n\\nIf you are on a laptop, slide your finger down the left (maybe right, I can\'t remember) of the finger-mouse-pad."}]}')}}]);
