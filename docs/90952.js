Second, new guy to server hates me but none of the main members do. Third, i warned 5 times before i gagged everyone. Bout 5 minutes apart for each warning, he was only one to complain AND only one that didn\'t listen to me explain for 5 minutes. The gag lasted one round before we switched maps so i didn\'t really do anything wrong. I told him he could make this post but no one else on the server argued about being muted, not even the 5 people who were constantly talking. He was one that was just trolling every here and there. With the amount of warnings i gave out and the time frame of the gag i think everything was legitimate to the rules i was told about. Im sry that rainrain and this guy think im bad, but with only about 3 people disliking me and wanting me demoted. I dont think i deserve a demotion just because someone most hated, Crazy Monkey or this random guy should matter, i do agree it mighta been mean to mute EVERY player, but if i didn\'t no one would get the hint and i couldn\'t tell everyone what they did wrong."},{"postId":4753,"topicId":519,"posterId":26,"postTime":1280205912,"postText":">> \\nIn my defense, rain. 10x more complaints bout u then me.
