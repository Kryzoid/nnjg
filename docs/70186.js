This ONLY warrants a slay and even if 1 was blatant it was from being trolled and no one doing anything. A ban for a week for 2 inno kills is plain out bullshit and you know it. I would say i am sorry for what i did, but he didn\'t apologize for trolling yet so i can\'t say i am sorry.\\n\\nA ban for a week isn\'t warranted for what happened since everyone else who has gotten banned for it was only a day at the most, regardless of first offense or not. This happened the day after i got unbanned because he was trolling me, if something was done about his trolling this incident wouldn\'t of happened. I requested a votekick that got ignored by all the VIPS on at the time and also kindly requested him to stop trolling/slay himself for a round. What i did wasn\'t in any case revenge but in order to stop being trolled for a round so i could enjoy a round without random troll comments.\\n\\nAs i said before, if anyone else did this on a repeat offense it would of only been 24 hours at most. You may say otherwise, but i\'ve seen people only be banned for a day on their 3rd offense. I believe i got banned more from the personal opinions this admin has against me then overall what happened. It was 2 kills this match, one of which i gave 3 warnings, and the other i gave 2 warning and then he trolled me. (may be wrong, but doesn\'t look like it)"},{"postId":26786,"topicId":3375,"posterId":612,"postTime":1311962194,"postText":"This will be the only post I make in this thread. \\n\\nThe only things obsessive said was\\nCrisis you are a faggot 2x\\nCrisis is on his period. \\n\\nI believe he had every right to kill you. \\nIn the video it is clear that obsessive came to the roof after Mortos was out of his sight. So, to him it looked like you just killed me. Not slayable. \\n\\nThe ban request doesn\'t really concern fudge being killed but the mic cutting out thing may warrant a slap for 50 DMG or something. But you CANNOT kill obsessive for saying \\"crisis you are on your period\\"\\n\\nYou know this is true because you call me a troll ALL THE TIME but never shoot me. \\n\\nYou revenge rdm\'d. Which is a 24 hour ban, for a first offense. Crisis you have to remember that you just got unbanned about 24 hours before this happened. And that is why it is elevated to a week. \\n\\nLast thought: I don\'t hate you. Actually at first I supplied the video to prove that you did get shot for killing me legit. I\'m not attacking you at all. That half-witted comment in the last thread was uncalled for. I\'m not recording only you. If you recall I said the video was really long. You had only gotten on a map before I think. \\n\\nIn the future, just don\'t let trolls get to ya man. Don\'t worry about them. When you react it\'s giving them what they want. These situations are ugly and no one wants to be in them. \\n\\nIf anyone has any questions, steam me. \\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/ishuu"},{"postId":26794,"topicId":3375,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311963150,"postText":"I try not to, but eventually enough is enough. To constantly troll me gets annoying, especially when VIPs dont think they have the right to do something.\\n\\nThere needs to be something that a normal player can do to the person who is trolling, if they type over chat. There is literally NOTHING we can do. You may say just deal with it till a admin joins. I messaged Quack and he said he\'d be there in a few to deal with it. After about 10-20 minutes i had enough of it since Quack didn\'t log on yet. If you want us to deal with it can we get a quicker response or maybe start forcing the VIPs to do something. They have mute and gag if i remember correctly. They can even vote kick the person. None of this was done which caused me to get upset to the fullest extent.\\n\\nThe server is constantly full so im not gonna leave to rejoin when it takes 10+ minutes to join. I believe this ban was extremely rash considering the circumstances and requesting it be removed or at the very least put to a lower ban sentence. Having to rdm a troll is extreme and shouldn\'t have to be done, but when VIPs refuse to help and mods/admins take forever to get on, what are we expected to do. You can only put up with a troll for so long before you want to do something to stop it.\\n\\nThis is of course looked at bad since i just came off a ban. But what you have to take into effect is the reasoning of all this happening. If i wasn\'t getting trolled and/or something was actually done to him this all would have been avoided. To me it feels like mods/admins refused to log on till after something happened so i could be rebanned. I messaged more then just Quack to log on but everyone else seemed afk or just plain out ignoring my plee for help.\\n\\n\\n EDIT BY DUM: Some posts after this one has been deleted, due to unneeded posting. Just to prevent myself from being a hypocrite, I\'m doing this here.

You said \\"don\'t follow me, warning one\\" then NOT EVEN 2 seconds later, gave the second warning. And on Corey, you didn\'t even give him a 3rd warning at all, it was 2 warnings, then you unloaded on him. The ban was made to a week because you decided to break the rules not even 24 hours after your previous ban. Take this as a break for you Crisis, to cool down. You seem to be tense from everyone just constantly on your ass (as you say). So maybe you just need to take a little break away from all of them, and come back with a fresh start. I will begin to ban for people trolling you.\\n\\nAlso, I don\'t hate you, and I am NOT holding a grudge. Both times I banned you, I did it with an admins consent on the whole entire situation. I never did it alone.\\n\\nI am going to keep this open cause I\'m the one that banned you, any other admin is open to responding and adding their thoughts."},{"postId":26922,"topicId":3375,"posterId":54,"postTime":1311997753,"postText":"Ban shortened, locked."}]}')}}]);
