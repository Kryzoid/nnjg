THE HORROR! Oh the rdm!\\n\\nYou claim you don\'t threaten admins or mods to act on it?\\nYou do and you just did. The proof is your own screenshot.\\n\\nYou should have atleast told everybody else why you were shooting. Why would they assume ANYTHING other than you\'re a traitor when you shoot somebody? Seriously?\\nNobody will just instantly know WHY you\'re shooting unless you tell them. It\'s your own fault."},{"postId":25926,"topicId":3271,"posterId":237,"postTime":1311189185,"postText":"you forgot the part where he threatened to RDM unless you did something."},{"postId":25927,"topicId":3271,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311189248,"postText":"Thats a remark not a threat, i was told specifically by Gash that if a mod+ refuses to do something to take a screen shot, i just have the courtesy to TELL them as a last warning to do something or i will have to post they arnt doing their job. Threats and promises are 2 different things.\\n\\nEDIT: I also never threatened to rdm anyone if he did nothing other then and i quote \\"If your not gonna stop the troll from saying shit over the mic, i will have to so i don\'t have to deal with it\\". Gag the trollers and i won\'t have to put up with them saying shit over the mic therefor i don\'t have to kill them for them to shut up. Considering all i asked for was a simple slay at first and you refused it i am asking for a hour to day ban since nothing else is done. I really ask for lighter punishments when online, when i have to waste my time because a admin or mod refuses to do the job they signed up for when online, i will ask for more.\\n\\nOverall I don\'t think what i asked for is much from someone who did bait and get someone rdm\'d for it, i don\'t believe that any of my ban requests are wrong moon, so you can stop responding to them because its a personal friend. Also don\'t use the excuse \\"your such a hippocrit (dunno how to spell and dont wanna waste time looking it up)\\". If im a hippocrit, then post a ban request on me. You say i deserve to be banned and troll me over chat and because no one cares i get trolled over chat its allowed.\\n\\nSo overall this ban request is for 1 hour to 1 day and i don\'t think he DOESN\'T deserve it. The proof is there and no need for anyone to post shit thats not needed (ie moon, making comments not needed on 2 ban requests now).\\n\\nIf you have problems, keep them to different forum topics or get proof against me doing shit, don\'t bring random crap up in here without proof."},{"postId":25928,"topicId":3271,"posterId":112,"postTime":1311189781,"postText":">> Thats a remark not a threat, i was told specifically by Gash that if a mod+ refuses to do something to take a screen shot, i just have the courtesy to TELL them as a last warning to do something or i will have to post they arnt doing their job.
