I was dead at the time i was blacklisted \\nLength of Ban/Date and time of Unban: Im honestly not sure. I looked at the sites ban list and i didnt find my name. All the servers were TTT so i think i did it wrong.\\nWhat server were you playing?: The Jailbreak server\\nWho banned you?: Not 100% sure because i was just kicked then i tryed to relog then i was banned, but i think it was batron(I think was his name& if hes an admin) \\nWhy should we unban you?: This server is honestly one of my favorite servers in Garrys mod and i have dedicated a lot of time to the server. I have a mic and most players have some fun with me while im online(other than Vasto and Godfather). So i hope one of the admins can forgive me and unban me. I would also like to know what blacklist abuse is."},{"postId":25082,"topicId":3151,"posterId":705,"postTime":1309484648,"postText":"I think i banned you for a mass freekill,if i am remembering correctly.And  usually  i dont perma unless someone was freekilling a lot.

I have had people purposely break the rules to get blacklisted so that they would never have to play guard and could always be a prisoner.  I consider this blacklist abuse because the blacklist is there to keep rule breaking guards off of the guard team, not lazy people who always want to be a prisoner.  When he said \\"Yay, no more guard\\", I assumed he had achieved his goal of never being a guard again."},{"postId":25211,"topicId":3151,"posterId":911,"postTime":1309774252,"postText":"hey this is godfather i dont like airsofter very much as he said himself but i will vouch for him\\nbecause he is not that bad i suggest a lighter punishment than a permanent or 1 week ban how about a day ban or blacklist instead  of a removal of playing at all just let him back on the server \\ni mean i play alot and he does too just give a second chance its the honorable thing to do.\\ni dont like him but i will vouch for him for a pretty unfair ban  just please give him a second chance everyone deserves a second chance if he does it again go ahead and ban just please give him another chance or a smaller punishment"},{"postId":25229,"topicId":3151,"posterId":920,"postTime":1309801660,"postText":">> hey this is godfather i dont like airsofter very much as he said himself but i will vouch for him\\nbecause he is not that bad i suggest a lighter punishment than a permanent or 1 week ban how about a day ban or blacklist instead  of a removal of playing at all just let him back on the server \\ni mean i play alot and he does too just give a second chance its the honorable thing to do.\\ni dont like him but i will vouch for him for a pretty unfair ban  just please give him a second chance everyone deserves a second chance if he does it again go ahead and ban just please give him another chance or a smaller punishment \\n\\nThank you for vouching for me.
