Upgrade - 250 points each, reduces recoil of HUGE\\n\\nLotsa people use huge because its good for close range spray-downs, recoil reduction could help that more. I dont know how many upgrades there\'d be.\\n\\nC4 Upgrade - 1000 points. Upgrades the C4 so that an extra wire detonates the bomb, except when that extra wire would make all six wires detonate.\\n\\nOne of the problems with 45 second C4\'s is that only one wire actually explodes the bomb. This upgrade would make two of the six wires detonate, increasing the chance from 1/6 to 1/3 of failed defusal. There could even be more than one upgrade. Adjust price as fit.\\n\\nBody Armor improvement - 750 points. Both detective and traitor. Increases effectiveness of body armor.\\n\\nI personally have no clue how body armor works. But I do tend to get it if i ever have a spare credit as traitor, it seems to increase my survivability by a bit. So there could be upgrades for it. Adjust price as fit.\\n\\nSuper Disguiser - 500 points. Must have upgraded disguiser. Also mimic\'s a player\'s hats, trails, etc.\\n\\nThis has been suggested before but I think it is very necessary.\\n\\nRadar Upgrade - ??? points. Lowers recharge time for radar.\\n\\nSelf-explanatory. I have no clue how many points it should cost, and whether it should be a one time cost for 15 second reduction or three upgrades of 5 seconds each.\\n\\nBody Bomb - 1000 points to unlock in traitor shop. Kill a victim, plant a bomb, run away. When the body is checked the bomb goes off.\\n\\nThis would add an actual use to binoculars, and could be extremely useful to traitors. It could be seen as overpowered, which is why it costs 1000 points. \\n\\nIn my opinion there should be a few more detective upgrades as well, but I\'m not really sure what can be upgraded.
