Today, I am applying for the position of administrator, possibly co-owner. I know, I know, many of you may ask, \\"But Sweetwater, you are so new! Sure, we dearly do love you, but why so quickly?\\" Well, friend, I only want the best for  YOU ,  THE SERVER  and  THE COMMUNITY . It is in my best interest to wipe the scum off of this server and create a new, better one to replace it! I hear some of you in the background, taunting me and laughing that they may not be accepting this position, but friend, I concur! There never is this \\"downtime\\" for office! You need a new admin, and I am him!\\nWhy vote for Sweetwater? I am a friend to kids and puppies alike. Is there an RDMer on the server? We\'ll baptize that bitch and butter him in the finest coat of JUSTICE! How about that ghoster? He lead no good life, now did he? In the afterlife, he only experiences hell! I will create a personal lounge room for ghosters where they may occupy their time by drinking refreshing beverages rather than calling out traitors! It is only good for you, so why not? I feel it is within my power to do this, thank you.\\nEarlier today, a man named \\"Blue\\" something had bid me farewell. I dearly feel sorry for him, but we will demote him because I just damn well please! Not only that, but with his absence we will fill his position with a new admin, Danger Close! Many of you know my friend, Danger Close, and you all very dearly love him, too! Gentlemen, I propose he becomes an admin, too! We will both work day and night just for you, the players!\\nPlease consider my proposal and reply with your answer, do you vote for me, or are you the scum that will say \\"No!\\" in the face of history in the making?"},{"postId":12397,"topicId":1372,"posterId":101,"postTime":1293165844,"postText":"Epic speech.\\n\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\n-\\"Blue\\" is a co-owner\\n-You did not use the template\\n-You did not apply in the correct forum\\n-I have no idea who the fuck you are, and I am on a lot\\n-I have a sense that you are the type of person who can walk in and think they are the shit\\n\\nHey look, I made a sideways pyramid!"},{"postId":12399,"topicId":1372,"posterId":272,"postTime":1293166062,"postText":"I have no idea who you are, and I\'m on more than Dum."},{"postId":12400,"topicId":1372,"posterId":101,"postTime":1293166125,"postText":">> I have no idea who you are, and I\'m on more than Dum. \\n\\n\\nNot really, I\'ve just been having a 2 day break, catching up with my old friends, playing minecraft+tf2 with them.
