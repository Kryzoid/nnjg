As well as most of the players that play on the TTT server.\\n\\nIt has been said MANY times that you can not shoot towards someone as it is traitor baiting. If you shoot at the ground or ceiling its fine, but soon as you shoot in a general direction it is traitor baiting. You ARE allowed to kill someone for it because they could be traitor just missing horribly at shooting. If someone kills you after you kill them for shooting towards someone/traitor baiting it is RDM. (At least from what I\'ve been told through asking Gash, and a few other admins). This post is because my recent ban request for 2 dumb people who killed me after i killed someone shooting out a open door that people walked through. The proof isn\'t enough because i was traitor and because of this every just doesn\'t give a shit about it. Destar said that he didn\'t shoot anyone, which is true. But he was shooting in the general area of a few people.\\n\\nThis thread is for the admins to respond CLEARLY about the rules of traitor baiting or randomly shooting towards someones general direction. From everything I\'ve heard it is a traitorous act and you can kill someone for it. I\'ve also been told that anyone who kills you AFTER you kill them for such a reason is RDM regardless.\\n\\nAlso, this thread needs NO RESPONSE from anyone but those with MOD or HIGHER, i cant stress this enough. It is not a thread for everyone to express there opinions and to just get a General Ruling on this specific rule in primarily the TTT server.\\n\\nAgain, Mod and Up only respond please. I don\'t want to see 30 posts from general people complaining that i made this post, trying to keep this as a dignified post."},{"postId":22381,"topicId":2781,"posterId":153,"postTime":1306011823,"postText":"If someone shoots near you, you may kill them.

If they kill me for it, usually they\'re the one who gets more mad out of the two of us, because yes, they have every right to kill if you\'re shooting at them. If someone is shooting at/ near you or others, and you kill them, you have done nothing wrong imo. If someone kills you for it technically it is rdm, but they should really listen to what you have to say first, especially if they saw the other guy shoot at you first. If they didn\'t see him shoot at you, and then it says he\'s innocent... people probably will kill you before you have time to explain. Technically this is rdm, but at the same time no less than killing someone who is shooting at people, because both are assumptions you have made. Sometimes TTT can be a fast paced game, and so you don\'t have time to ask questions for fear of them killing you... \\n\\nPoint i\'m getting at here is that unless they see him shoot at you first, and then see you kill him it is not rdm. If they did see him shoot at you first, then it was rdm and punishable.\\n\\nOh and i agree with that guy. If the one baiting gets killed by someone, and then the one who killed the baiter gets killed, if any punishment is going to happen it would be against the baiter."},{"postId":22413,"topicId":2781,"posterId":517,"postTime":1306040887,"postText":"So if i kill someone who is shooting near me, and i get banned, will one of the smart admins unban me?"},{"postId":22420,"topicId":2781,"posterId":153,"postTime":1306061848,"postText":">> So if i kill someone who is shooting near me, and i get banned, will one of the smart admins unban me?â€‰\\nIf that\'s the only reason you got banned, than yes"}]}')}}]);
