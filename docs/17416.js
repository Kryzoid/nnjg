Though it was pretty clear that these two did not know the rules or even needed to be vip. I would of got thair Id\'s and stuff but I had to leave before I could. Though I\'m not saying big rules to become vip just small things like knowing the rules and things around this sort. Also the guys I blacklisted didnt seem to have a vip request post unless its hidden."},{"postId":38016,"topicId":4913,"posterId":812,"postTime":1321472862,"postText":"I totally agree with this.\\n\\nWhile I\'m not suggesting we deny their donation, just maybe a waiting period before they actually receive the VIP powers, and become aware of how to use them.
