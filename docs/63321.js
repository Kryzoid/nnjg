TGK, I don\'t like to make enemies here, so im just going to tell you some neutral information. You have been a server member for a while, and that is good. But if you want to impress the forum mods and look like an active (Yet not spamming) poster, then just do as said above and maybe make a post or two a day.\\n\\nYou said you enforced the rules, and that is good. I\'m not quite sure that screenshot involved rule enforcement, but just don\'t let it happen again, and you should be good to go (Although it says you have been demoted.) This leads me to another point.\\n\\nSince you have been demoted, you will really have to go that extra mile to show other\'s that you have what it takes to become a moderator. Stay active on the forum, help newbies to the server out, (whether on the forum or in game) and follow the rules as if your life depended on it. \\n\\nYour in game name is a bit obscene. Your Mother doesn\'t send a good message out to those who would be the ones to recruit you. If I were you, I would change it to something much more level-headed and mature, like TGK_ReapaZ, at least, because personally, i wouldn\'t make you mod with a name like that (No offense.)\\n\\nBasically, just follow the rules, remain active, and make some slight adjustments and you sir could be on the road to becoming a mod. I have faith in you, so just give it a while, and try your best, and i might be hearing news of a promotion in a little while. :)\\n\\nCheers, \\n\\nnicholsml A.K.A. Rainbow Dash"}]}')}}]);
