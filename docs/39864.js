Is it possible to get CS 1.6 Maps on GMOD? (I\'m pretty sure answer is no since it aint a source game :[)\\n\\nIf you guys have CS 1.6. Try going into a server with the map ms_jailbreak or some1s_jailbreak. Those are prob the 2 most popular maps in JailBreak in cs 1.6.\\n\\nThen possibly have someone make a remake or something along those kind of maps. Might increase the number of different things people can do."},{"postId":14334,"topicId":1645,"posterId":313,"postTime":1295205389,"postText":"Flame you know cs pro mod? \\ncs 1.6 with cs :s textures and blablabla \\ntry to find that maps :3"},{"postId":14338,"topicId":1645,"posterId":389,"postTime":1295211643,"postText":"LoL the moment i started playing gmod and League of Legends....
