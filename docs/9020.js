It would be easier to code and I could see it causing a lot of havoc and helping the traitors. I can imagine someone standing over it and looking down trying to ID it, putting them in a perfect spot for knife/snipe/deagle and also making them look suspicious even if they are inno. Of course this would mean no calling detectives to it as bait."},{"postId":18580,"topicId":2247,"posterId":375,"postTime":1302140659,"postText":">> >> We should also get a traitor weapon like a grenade launcher where the grenades are the ones you pick up. \\n\\nOr you could just throw it. \\nWell it would launch it farther liek across the map if you aim it right.
