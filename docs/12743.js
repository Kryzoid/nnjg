I\'m sure most of you will not care and think lightly of me and that is to be expected. For the few who do care I would like to say my thanks and fuck you\'s. First off bird, you\'re one of the greatest people on the clan, seriously, you really deserve more for all that you do, I love you man. Kryzoid You are quite an interesting person, I do enjoy conversing with you and it feels like I\'m not talking with the likes of a pre- pubescent 13 year old. To my good friend Etrius you\'re a good friend and I have taught you well, that is all. Bewm when ever you get back on remember, you were one of the few people I admire for not losing it when people were acting like complete idiots, hence Mr.gash. For the one named Crazy monkey, I like you, sure you\'re kind of a dick but you\'re still doing your job, sorta.[Quick Tip for CrazyMonkey] if you want to help the clan don\'t bitch at people who make you angry with their posts, remember the undergraduate [NNJG] members of today, are the admins of tomorrow. Pharaoh I\'m not sure what to say about you other then, you\'re two faced, you seem nice when I talk to you in game but on here you basically tell me what I\'m doing is wrong and misconstrue mostly everything I try to get across. Ben, meh, I ain\'t got no beef wich you.\\nTime for the Shit list.\\nDum, you argue every chance you get with me, you don\'t seem to enjoy logic as to blatant finger pointing. I don\'t think you even know what you\'re doing sometimes it\'s ridicules, you\'re childish and uneducated, you also have the fun game in which you do it\'s called, taking sides without any logic other then, wow he\'s telling him off and he\'s a mod/admin, he must be right! Mr.gash, the only reason and I MEAN THE  ONLY  REASON, you\'re in power is because you half own the server, seriously, you do nothing but boss people around you do nothing to fix the problem other then banning.[Quick tip for Mr.Gash] Maybe just maybe, you might want to resolve the issue by talking to the player, not threatening them or banning them. You seem to enjoy making up shit that needs to be fixed even though the clan is fine in the area that you say needs improving. I have never had a more arrogant and misunderstanding leader in my 15 years of gaming. (For those who think when a number is said it equals my age, I started playing vidya games when I was 3, what\'s 3+15)\\nYou also hurt the clan more then anything else. [Do not take this part as me being angry] I\'m curious, why was my moderator taken away? I wasn\'t needed? I said that the clan is dieing? I said the clan needed improving? 1st: I wasn\'t needed, how, the fact that I\'m on the website at 3:00 to 4:00am. I\'m watching so nothing happens, here\'s a thought, what would be the best time for a DDoser or hacker to get on,  Night time  because he/she would know everyone\'s off, I watch this place like a hawk during the night, also do you see anyone on as late as me that\'s not afk. 2nd: Yes the clan is dieing, people are not respectful to each other, we all butt heads and people are just not coming like they used to. \\n3rd: The clan does need improving from what was said in number 2, I was also willing to help improve the clan, but instead I get my moderator ship taken away because I wasn\'t needed, I like how you told me I wasn\'t needed but nobody ever told me what I should have done to be useful. (Don\'t tell me that I needed to be more active on the jail server, I\'m talking about the forum not the jail server, also be more active on the jail server, I had been on for 3 straight weeks each day, I needed a break. Oh but Swaim I never saw you on when I was on, yah I\'m not fucking on 24/7)\\nBasically the reason for me leaving is that I don\'t like the way things are ran, people misunderstand and become angered like ravage monkeys. Hopefully one day you guys will one day become fun and awesome again.\\n\\nGash I don\'t hate you man, you just need some more growing up is all.\\nP.S. I will be replying to comments or questions for couple days. Again, thank you all whom who were kind and cool with me over the months of gaming, I will be happy to rejoin the clan when everything is running smooth or I get better reasoning from your comments. I also don\'t want to leave on a bad note so here something funny I discovered. \\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIafaUfkLSQ  <-----  SUCH AN OBVIOUS HACKER LINK DURRRRR  it\'s just a funny video don\'t be so paranoid."},{"postId":16145,"topicId":1947,"posterId":112,"postTime":1298115342,"postText":"I don\'t mean to be two faced >.> I was trying to let you know the rules although I probally didn\'t do it in the best way because I\'ve been in a bad mood recently :/\\n\\nIt sucks to see you go D;"},{"postId":16151,"topicId":1947,"posterId":82,"postTime":1298132589,"postText":"I didn\'t get a mention!

Every time I saw you post, you had some kind of a downer attitude. Then when I saw you posting negative about the clan I didn\'t like it. And during the day; the servers get really good population. (Not RP and Flood) but TTT and Jail usually are occupied with a GOOD amount of users in them during the day. I\'m sorry I went off on you, but I just hate to see people talk bad about the clan. I have been with NNJG since Shadow\'s Jail. I was here since I was like 12, lmao. But you were all in all a good mod on the servers, but the forums, I saw you a different way and always saw you in a different perspective."},{"postId":16171,"topicId":1947,"posterId":366,"postTime":1298172860,"postText":"You have mentioned \\"Shadows Jail\\" Will you explain?"},{"postId":16172,"topicId":1947,"posterId":4,"postTime":1298177939,"postText":">> You have mentioned \\"Shadows Jail\\" Will you explain? \\nShadow\'s Jail was Mr. Gash\'s first server, his old nickname was \\"Shadow\\"\\nIt soon turned into TTT when he merged with Ben in NNJG.\\nGood times....PINGAS"},{"postId":16173,"topicId":1947,"posterId":2,"postTime":1298181896,"postText":">> >> You have mentioned \\"Shadows Jail\\" Will you explain? \\nShadow\'s Jail was Mr. Gash\'s first server, his old nickname was \\"Shadow\\"\\nIt soon turned into TTT when he merged with Ben in NNJG.\\nGood times....PINGAS \\n\\nShitlong version:\\n>> I\'m a friendly guy if you know me. I joined the GMod community a while back, and the first server I was on was on epic_city4. I didn\'t know what the fuck I was doing. I played around on Gmod, never on singleplayer, not knowing what to do. I joined a DarkRP server called \\"Redd\'s RP\\", but at the time I only joined because it was on gm_construct. I asked how to favorite it, and the admin at the time told me how. After that almost every time I went on GMod, that was the only server I went to. Once a couple months passed by, I obtained Admin, and kept the peace around the server, which had a lot of people and a lot of rule breakers. Redd\'s RP didn\'t last long after I became admin, because a couple weeks, which seemed like months, he started adding a lot of people to admin, and the server lost it\'s reputation for good players and non-abusing admins. It turned into an admin fight almost every time it was up, and not many people roleplayed. I made a DarkRP server of my own, added a couple awesome things, and I got my friends from Redd\'s RP to join it. We had some fun over Christmas, making the map gm_snowstruct2 and making a tree, giving shipments as gifts and coloring them red, with rope wraping paper. The server eventually died, and in it\'s ashes grew a new server, Shadow\'s Jail Server. At the time my name was .\\\\\\\\Shadow}, hence the name Shadow. A guy named Non-Toxic, a dev on Redd\'s RP, helped me out to improve it, and with that I showed Kryzoid, a friend from youtube (http://www.youtube.com/kryzoid) my server, along with my friend turtle (youtube.com/Turtle1057), who we always went on to have fun. It was an amazing server, and we even got a mapper. The server was a 30 slot, and was almost always full. I got a couple donators, including benc555. The server closed after awhile, due to a billing issue with Xenon Servers (xenonservers.com) and it was closed, in addition I had no back ups of the game files for the Jail server. A little after that time, benc555, made a Clan called No Nerds Just Geeks ([NNJG]), around that time I changed my name to Mr. Gash, a character in a book I read. I had around 200 people on my friends list when he made that group, most of them removed now, but at the time I invited everyone to the group. He made me a Co-Owner of it. I bought a new server from Xenon Servers, and tried to re-create the amazing gameplay that used to be Shadow\'s Jail. It failed. Coding for that gamemode was a lot of work, and it didn\'t work correctly. Non-Toxic almost never comes on now, so I had no help from him. I made the server a Trouble In Terrorist Town server, but I didn\'t have a clan for it. So I asked Ben if I could put the [NNJG] tag on it, and he said yes. After that I learned some Lua, and started adding things to the server by myself. Turtle almost never is on Steam anymore, or youtube. I don\'t really know about his story, but Kryzoid is still with us at No Nerds Just Geeks. If you would like to see any of us, drop on by at one of our servers. "},{"postId":16175,"topicId":1947,"posterId":54,"postTime":1298192751,"postText":"aka I\'ve been around for a long time."},{"postId":16176,"topicId":1947,"posterId":153,"postTime":1298208996,"postText":"Are you forgetting Shadows RP?"},{"postId":16181,"topicId":1947,"posterId":101,"postTime":1298219068,"postText":"Maybe its because I yell at you when I come on and I see you yelling in your mic to the whole server about a rule that you thought was true but wasn\'t -_-"},{"postId":16184,"topicId":1947,"posterId":4,"postTime":1298222118,"postText":">> Ben\\":1991n26w]Are you forgetting Shadows RP? \\nNo, and i didn\'t forget about Shadow\'s Flood either, i think that the summarized version pretty much got the message across.
