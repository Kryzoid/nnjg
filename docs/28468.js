It was my first day playing on it and I was impressed. Anyways, I was eventually banned for ghosting in gm_southpark. I go by the name boogies2 on steam, however. Anyways, I was asked by Pharaoh when we were dead if I was ghosting. I said yes, because I thought it meant free spectating. I was roaming around the map, dead, spectating people from afar. I don\'t think my vocabulary was right though, because right after I said yes, I was banned. I\'m assuming by ghosting he meant being able to walk through walls while alive.\\nNote to mods: If this isn\'t in the right place, my bad :)\\nThanks\\n       -Boogies2\\\\Showboo"},{"postId":24917,"topicId":3123,"posterId":907,"postTime":1309189241,"postText":"Oops.

( He stopped room claiming when I asked, so the ban wasn\'t for that) So you two were already allies before the round started, which is... coincident.\\nHe left the house and about 10 seconds later I betrayled you.
