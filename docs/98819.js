Everyone knows Cake, people that have been around the server longer call me by Cake anyway, but I love Sanya. She is my smexi loli, and it\'s different which is good cause I get bored and wanna shake it up. Maybe I should go back to Cake and keep Sanya pic, but that doesn\'t sound fun. Maybe I can just switch between then as I feel like it like Gash does with Shadow. Idk let me know, I am obviously indecisive. Oh and I have to mention Punked\'s suggestion of Sancake lol."},{"postId":4727,"topicId":516,"posterId":2,"postTime":1280177386,"postText":"Cake om nom"},{"postId":4728,"topicId":516,"posterId":67,"postTime":1280177799,"postText":"Keep it Cake, or else people we Really start to have a hard time knowing if youre male / female w/o hearing voice lol"},{"postId":4729,"topicId":516,"posterId":4,"postTime":1280178272,"postText":"Personally i think you should be Sanya, cake is a very common name, and its annoying because there could be multiple cake screen names out there.\\nBut Sanya...eh, girl screen name?\\n\\nBe Just Call Me Cake or one of the old names you had\\n\\nSancake also is pretty cool"},{"postId":4730,"topicId":516,"posterId":13,"postTime":1280181745,"postText":">> \\nPersonally i think you should be Sanya, cake is a very common name, and its annoying because there could be multiple cake screen names out there.\\nBut Sanya...eh, girl screen name?\\n\\nBe Just Call Me Cake or one of the old names you had\\n\\nSancake also is pretty cool\\n \\nThat is like the exact reason I changed it, I liked it when I was only Cake, but then people with cake in name started showing up and I felt generic :(.

Yeah if I ever see you set as L, I set mine as Light.
