It would increase frames per second. Which inturn would allow for higher resolution which would then increase graphic quality, making thy game lookith better. Monitors are usually only upgraded because the consumer would like to add size. So. If you have a shit card, such as that 1200 series, id definitely go for the card. Id say Nvidia but thats mainly opinion. They update drivers more often, better cp, more options.etc. But if you have like a 17\'\' monitor, upgrade the monitor. It\'s going to cost you though. Also monitors, if ( the game you are playing) is not set at the monitor\'s optimal resolution will cost you visual quality. So... Id gun for a new card. But keep in mind, that if youre going to buy it. Buy big. Because games seem to get more an more quality hungry. So if you plan on buy new games, you\'ll need a card. \\n\\nSide note: you\'re operating system( windows i assume) will only use a certain amount of ram, regardless of how much you have installed. I have 5 gigs. But my 32 bit vista only uses 3.7, leave the rest to waste. So ram isn\'t really useful unless you have sayy 2 gb?"},{"postId":18637,"topicId":2304,"posterId":586,"postTime":1302304630,"postText":"More info:\\n\\nOS: Windows 7\\nUpgrading for: Games n stuff< Crysis 2, Portal 2 n stuff\\\\\\n\\n>> what\'s your budget? \\n\\nWhat budget? :O, Jk, $500"},{"postId":18648,"topicId":2304,"posterId":612,"postTime":1302315581,"postText":"Grab you a Nvidia geforce 460 gtx\\nItll run you about 300$ but see what kind of graphic adapter you have.
