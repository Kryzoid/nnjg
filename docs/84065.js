I joined the GMod community a while back, and the first server I was on was on epic_city4. I didn\'t know what the fuck I was doing. I played around on Gmod, never on singleplayer, not knowing what to do. I joined a DarkRP server called \\"Redd\'s RP\\", but at the time I only joined because it was on gm_construct. I asked how to favorite it, and the admin at the time told me how. After that almost every time I went on GMod, that was the only server I went to. Once a couple months passed by, I obtained Admin, and kept the peace around the server, which had a lot of people and a lot of rule breakers. Redd\'s RP didn\'t last long after I became admin, because a couple weeks, which seemed like months, he started adding a lot of people to admin, and the server lost it\'s reputation for good players and non-abusing admins. It turned into an admin fight almost every time it was up, and not many people roleplayed. I made a DarkRP server of my own, added a couple awesome things, and I got my friends from Redd\'s RP to join it. We had some fun over Christmas, making the map gm_snowstruct2 and making a tree, giving shipments as gifts and coloring them red, with rope wraping paper. The server eventually died, and in it\'s ashes grew a new server, Shadow\'s Jail Server. At the time my name was .\\\\\\\\Shadow}, hence the name Shadow. A guy named Non-Toxic, a dev on Red\'\'\'s RP, helped me out to improve it, and with that I showed Kryzoid, a friend from youtube (http://www.youtube.com/kryzoid) my server, along with my friend turtle (youtube.com/Turtle1057), who we always went on to have fun. It was an amazing server, and we even got a mapper. The server was a 30 slot, and was almost always full. I got a couple donators, including benc555. The server closed after awhile, due to a billing issue with Xenon Servers (xenonservers.com) and it was closed, in addition I had no back ups of the game files for the Jail server. A little after that time, benc555, made a Clan called No Nerds Just Geeks ([NNJG]), around that time I changed my name to Mr. Gash, a character in a book I read. I had around 200 people on my friends list when he made that group, most of them removed now, but at the time I invited everyone to the group. He made me a Co-Owner of it. I bought a new server from Xenon Servers, and tried to re-create the amazing gameplay that used to be Shadow\'s Jail. It failed. Coding for that gamemode was a lot of work, and it didn\'t work correctly. Non-Toxic almost never comes on now, so I had no help from him. I made the server a Trouble In Terrorist Town server, but I didn\'t have a clan for it. So I asked Ben if I could put the [NNJG] tag on it, and he said yes. After that I learned some Lua, and started adding things to the server by myself. Turtle almost never is on Steam anymore, or youtube. I don\'t really know about his story, but Kryzoid is still with us at No Nerds Jsut Geeks.
