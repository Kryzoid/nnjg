Which is cool. I hated high school. Unfortunately, the issue of college is making itself more difficult than it needs to be.\\n\\nSometime in March, I applied to two colleges. I wasn\'t quite sure which one of them I really wanted to go to at the time, which is a standard thing.\\nSometime in April, I decided which college I wanted to go to. The other college called me and asked if I still wanted to go. I kindly told them that I would be attending a different college.\\nMy parents handle all of my brother and I\'s mail. My brother and I only ever receive what my parents decide to tell us about. Because of this, I wasn\'t able to join the National Honors Society in high school, nor have I ever seen any of my report cards. This didn\'t fully bother me, because I had always assumed that they would tell us if we had mail that was truly important.\\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\nThe college I wanted to attend has this freshman orientation thing that you have to sign up for, and that\'s where you sign up for classes and stuff. You also have to give them a $150 fee.\\nTurns out, the deadline to submit both was on May 1st. May 1st. Over a month ago. I was never told any of this. It was in a letter that my parents got sometime in the second half of April. They never told me. When I asked them about it, they told me it was my fault and that I should have known. I got yelled at for \\"being lazy and trying to blame it on them.\\" What?!\\n\\nI saw a little light at the end of the tunnel. About a week ago I decided to get the mail before them. I got a letter from that college. They said it was still possible to sign up, but I would only get in if there was room. Hooray, there\'s still hope! Right? Wrong. I told my parents about it, and they said, \\"Oh yeah, we\'ll do that sometime this week.\\" \\n\\nLater that week, they informed me that they didn\'t want me to go to that college because they felt it\'s too far for a new driver to drive to every day.\\nAhem? My brother had a longer drive to college every day when he first started, and they had no problem with him going.\\nThis also made me wonder, \\"Did they just hide the letter because they didn\'t want me to go there?\\"\\nIf so, that\'s dumb. \\nThey want me to go to schools closer to home. How am I supposed to apply to them exactly? I can\'t exactly go to the guidance counselor\'s office and ask her to send them my transcript. SCHOOL IS CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER. Not to mention the college they want me to go to doesn\'t have the courses I want to take, and since all the dumb kids go there, there most likely won\'t even be room for me to attend.\\n\\nI guess I don\'t really have a problem with missing a semester of college. Oh, wait. I\'m not allowed to do that either. My mom yelled at me for 15 minutes for explaining to her the only possible outcome. \\"Your dad\'s insurance won\'t cover you if you\'re not a full-time student!\\" Well then mother, why didn\'t you tell me you didn\'t want me to go to that college sooner!? It would have saved us all a lot of trouble!\\n\\nIn short, FML.\\n\\nI really hope this all gets sorted out soon. I really do."},{"postId":24031,"topicId":3020,"posterId":586,"postTime":1308087865,"postText":"Your parents are trolls"},{"postId":24032,"topicId":3020,"posterId":272,"postTime":1308087991,"postText":"Good luck, Peram, I don\'t really have anything else to say though."},{"postId":24033,"topicId":3020,"posterId":488,"postTime":1308088471,"postText":">> Your parents are trolls \\n\\nIndeed.
