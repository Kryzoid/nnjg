They like to play on my steam games and gmod is one of \\nthier favorites so i let them play sometimes. the middle brother knows the rules but thought it would be funny to RDM\\nand unfortunetely my account was banned today. If theres any way I could get an unban thrown my way I\'d really appreciate it.\\nI have to work alot during the week to help with food, clothes for them and gmod is my downtime to relax at night.\\n\\nthank you for your time,\\n\\nAustin (spookydog13)"},{"postId":24775,"topicId":3103,"posterId":112,"postTime":1308923203,"postText":"You might want to take another look at the unban request information. \\nNamely this part right here:\\n>> \\n I NEVER want to see you say \\"My brother/cousin/mother in law broke the rules, it wasn\'t me.  Your account.
