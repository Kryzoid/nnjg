Read it knowing that spelling was taking a back seat on this one)\\n\\nI think the TMP has to be upgraded... but not a shop upgrade. P90 Shots fast and can compet with the Level 4 mac 10 upgrade... the thing is... tmp is not... Overall... Its just a shitty weapon. suppressing the sound the tmp makes, as well, maybe adding no death scream Will make the gun a viable option.\\n\\nNote, P90 is good where it is... its a very powerfull weapon up close and can easly compeat with people with mac 10 upgrade... Increasing Clip Size would unbalace the Sub-machinguns again... Whice used to be P90,Mac10,TMP\\n\\nNote: Lazer sights would make it easyer to shot moving targets even when your moving... But we already have hit markers.\\n\\nI do not agree with the shotgun ideas... If you want power and spread... go with the M3... want rate of fire with less spread, Auto-shotgun.\\n\\nGlock... Umm... Personly, I just don\'t want the glock to become my second machingun...\\nStill, I love your idea with being able to swith between single,burst,fully., when it comes to the pistols. Maybe a shop upgread that makes all pistols you pick up fully auto.\\n\\nMaybe we can add in some new guns?.? How about a burst fire Fames. As well a second sniper for innocents would be nice. Note: Incindary ammo did not count.\\n\\nOverall, I agree with being able to turn pistols full auto with some kind of shop upgrade.\\nI agree with making the TMP balance, by making it a silent killer. May undermind the Silenced Pistol if its not upgreaded too somehow.\\nAnd when it comes to the recoil of the AK, as long as its not huge reduse. One thing... Why is it that AK dose not take AsultRifle ammo... That always puzzled me. Is it a glich no one fixed... Or was it done this say becase it would add another Sub-gun to P90,Mac10,TMP... Because its a real pain when somone with an AK takes my Mac10 ammo.\\n\\nOverall, I don\'t agree with any shop upgrades for any of the shotguns. \\nI don\'t agree with an ammo or rate of fire increase for glock.\\n\\nI\'m on the fench with the lazer Sight. \\nIf the person with the upgrade could only do it to one weapon per match, and if it can be put on traitor/detective guns. I\'d say yes.\\nAdded.,\\nMaybe if a person who dose not have that upgrade kills someone who did buy it and equipted it onto there weapon. Then the person who picks up that weapon will still have that upgrade on it.\\n\\n-Edit-\\n\\nI\'m also finding it hard to play ttt.\\nIt simply no longer keeps me at the edge of my seat.\\nAs a result, I am becoming more inactive considering... TTT is the only reason I\'m on NNJG.\\nAs a secondary result, my input on how the game can be inproved may not be as good as an active players might.\\nI\'m trying to join more, but I\'m just to bored... That and every time I finally want to join, server is full...\\n\\nANOTHER THING, can NNJG consider opening up a second server for TTT?\\nOr.,\\nAtleast increase the slots to somthing higher."},{"postId":36964,"topicId":4412,"posterId":1087,"postTime":1320271199,"postText":"Oky one thing to say.

If you jihad into a large group, you have a fairly decent chance of getting shot down. The post-explosion would just make it so that they die anyways.
