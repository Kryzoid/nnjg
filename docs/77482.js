I know I\'d be banned along with a lot of others. The only thing I can see here of admin disrespect.

I don\'t understand why you would join the group in the first place, and remain banned from a community (I thought) you liked when it\'s that simple to get unbanned.  You don\'t have to agree with everyone who is on the server, and if you liked it in general I don\'t see why you would leave over this.  Anyway, I don\'t know what your feelings are on it and it is your choice.  Sorry you chose to leave,  I sincerely wish you luck in finding a good community to be with.

No where in the rules does it state that a person can be banned for being in a group outside of anything related to NNJG. Sure it\'s disrespecting a person, if you can consider it disrespect, but that\'s all it is, just one person. It\'s not bashing in on NNJG nor the rest of the community from what I read. From the group, \\"This group is about how Udane should not have power for he does only wrong with it.\\" That is not disrespect at all, at least I consider it not to be. It\'s a opinion and nothing more and if you say something about how it says to blame NNJG, blah blah then I answer with this, blaming NNJG is not disrespect either, it\'s a statement or an opinion and nothing more. If you think it is disrespect then please give a good reason other than saying that \\"Oh they say I shouldn\'t have mod/admin blah blah.\\""},{"postId":37580,"topicId":4854,"posterId":605,"postTime":1320876839,"postText":"\\"This group is a branch off The Mr. Gash Defamation League.\\" I believe this here is the key phrase that lead to the group ban. \\nIf you weren\'t around for the first Defamation League, I\'d doubt you\'d understand.\\nAs of writing this post, I only reconize Danny in that group, who I legitmately banned/got banned, but whined for months about how trolling is not bannable, how he could do whatever he pleases.\\nIf it\'s players hating before they even join, why would you want them even in a server?"},{"postId":37581,"topicId":4854,"posterId":735,"postTime":1320876915,"postText":"I guess people can\'t take criticism at all."},{"postId":37598,"topicId":4854,"posterId":243,"postTime":1320883326,"postText":"I can\'t believe I\'m posting this, I\'m really losing faith in people.\\n\\nWhy in the  WORLD  would you  JOIN  a hate group?\\nIf you hate someone, tell them, it\'s not disrespect if you have reasons other than discriminatory features, such as skin colour, personality, etc.\\n\\nIf you don\'t like someone, be mature.

It is their choice whether they want to join that group or not. There will always be haters who dislike the way you do things, but that\'s the way it is, banning them isn\'t gonna stop them. No offense but seeing as that they are apart of S3G and yet they haven\'t banned the entire group of NNJG proves that they are somewhat better than some people here. In terms of players and what not, to each their own. As to the plans they have listed on the Anti Gash group, they have not done any of that aside from 1-4 people from S3G. That includes Mak and the other guy w/e who deleted half the forums or so but that was before the group was even made. So in my opinion, you guys are just adding fuel to the flame which might prove a problem later on. Here\'s a suggestion for Gash,  Don\'t ban everyone in a group  because it will give them more reasons to continue this. Ignore them and their reason for making the group and keeping it might go away along with people abandoning it. People sees what that group sees and side with them because you give them reason to.\\n\\nEdit: I am not trying to defend them but I am trying to defend their right to do so or a person\'s right to join the group. So basically it\'s just you trying to take control of the internet and determine what is right and what is wrong for people. And by banning an entire group based on their opinion, you are taking away their right or free will and shoving down their throats of what they should be doing and what they shouldn\'t be. I get this is your community, but in no way bad or good are they threatening to attack NNJG in its entirety.

If you make NNJG look bad, we lose players. \\n\\nHate groups, if involving NNJG members or the community, should be dealt with. Of course, what is ok, and what isnt, is a different thing. For example, if I were to create a group to attempt to demote Playerhata, or state how terrible he is, thats fine. If you bring NNJG into it, then it becomes a problem. \\n\\nNow, in this instance, if it was a \\"branch off of The Mr. Gash Defamation League\\". That group has already been banned.
