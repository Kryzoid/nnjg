Their choice of 1,000 TTT points or 5,000 puzzle points (when I get dem puzzle points) and;\\nTheir own custom map to be worked on with their own name. Every detail of this map will be up to the winner. Whatever textures they want, whatever design, everything, and I will make it up to specification. The winner may select any of the gamemodes listed for their map: puzzle, ttt, jail. (if you select jail, i may have to research it more before i map for it). When the map is completed, not only will I give them the playable map file, but the editable map file for hammer as well.*\\nThe rules are very simple.
