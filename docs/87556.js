I say, NO! i didnt do anything, dont shoot me! here check my shotgun, it has full ammo!\\n\\nBam. i get shot by \\"Freelancer\\". I slay him for rdm because he CLAIMS that i could have gotten ammo after killing a person if i had, which i hadn\'t. the kill happened AFTER i got ammo, anyone that was in the room when i was getting ammo could have known that.

I don\'t know who accused us, but it has to be the most random thing that has happened to me on TTT. I hadn\'t done anything and no more than a minute into a round, someone said KOS kryzoid. Then they included Punk/Flowers for some reason. I was getting nervous because i knew someone was going to rdm me again, so i decided to kill all the innocents in the room. I killed 6 innocents that round (fucking awesome :D) but the thing is, i never complained to you after killing me. You had a perfectly good reason to kill me, you saw that i was killing everyone.
