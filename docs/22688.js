We checked the logs, and you guys were yelling about \\"Loving to see the world burn.\\"\\nYou know who you are.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to appeal this,  you need to wait until the official announcement that the server is publicly open ,  then  PM an admin and ask for the ban to be lifted.\\nI can guarantee that if you ask before we go public, that ban won\'t be lifted.\\n\\nSecondly, flint and steel are now a locked item.\\nThey can only be used by admins, currently. They may stay this way.\\nThe way we see it, there are only two uses for fire: decoration, and griefing.\\nTherefore, if you need something lit for decoration, call an Admin or Mod over. They\'ll do it for you.\\n\\nLava buckets and TNT may follow this, depending on whether or not they are abused.\\nDon\'t make us do this. We want to be able to trust you guys with simple fucking items.\\n\\nSorry if this seems rash, rude, or snappy.\\n We spent  an hour and a fucking half  putting the forest out.\\nWe\'re tired.\\n\\n No tl;dr.
