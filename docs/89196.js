They are the ones that control the prisoners and, if the prisoners are compliant, they direct the prisoners in a variety of fun games, some listed in the guide. \\n\\nGuards spawn with a randomized primary weapon and a USP every round. VIPs also spawn with some extra weapons that are a bit better than the rest.\\n\\n Weapons that you can spawn with as a guard \\nM4A1 - Also known as the maverick m4 carbine. Good all around weapon with a silencer option.\\nAUG - Bullpup aug. Zoom option. Slower firing rate than the M4. Long range and powerful, low recoil.\\nFamas - High rate of fire, low recoil. Also known as the Clarion. Has a burst fire option.\\nP90 - High fire rate, high recoil, huge clip size, pretty accurate long range but low damage.\\nLeone 12 guage - Shotgun, low rate of fire, gets a good 100 hp if shot to the chest. Burst fire/slug shot options.\\n\\n Additional VIP weapons \\nAutoshotgun - IMO the best weapon in the game. Good short range, lower damage than the Leone but automatic. 7 shells.\\nUMP - Good rate of fire, semi-good damage. Has semi-automatic option.\\nMP5 - Better rate of fire than the UMP. Good damage.\\nTMP - Best rate of fire in the gamemode. Bad damage.\\nAWP - Sniper rifle. One shot, one kill. Very accurate, suggested for a support weapon because it is not automatic. \\nScout - Less damage than the AWP, higher rate of fire. Still only good as a support weapon.\\n\\n General tips \\n-Watch all exits. I.E. on escape the main exit of cellblock and the vents.\\n-Check the cells if you can. Prisoners like to hide in their cells if they don\'t like the orders.\\n-If any guards die, get their guns out as fast as you can. There\'s nothing better a prisoner would like to do than grab a nearby gun and kill some guards.\\n-Don\'t bait. This is when you stand within knifing range of the prisoners. I will slay for this because it leads to freeshooting, freekilling, and general whining.\\n-Discipline them. For example, if they are lined up on a wall, make them unstack and freeze. If they are stacked, it gives them a sense of invincibility and will be more likely to rebel.\\n-Communicate with your fellow guards. If you don\'t talk to eachother and you go off to kill a rebeller, and the rebeller wins, the other guards will never know what happened because you did not convey his location, successfully losing you the round.\\n\\n Popular generic jailbreak games \\n\\nLast reaction - All the prisoners line up. If the lead says last reaction jump/crouch, then you kill the last person that jumps/crouches. If he says first reaction jump/crouch, then you kill the first person that jumps/crouches. Last one gets lr.\\nSimon says - Lead is simon, prisoners do whatever simon says. Lots of traps involved.\\nTrivia day - Lead types out a question, whoever answers it right gets to keep a prize or pass it to someone else(Can be good or bad, like choose 2 prisoners to die or death)\\nPokemon day - Lead is guard pokemon master, a prisoner pokemon master is appointed by the lead. Both pokemon masters choose \\"Pokemon\\" (players) to fight eachother. \\nBoxing day - Prisoners and guards fight eachother. Usually ends up with guards misunderstanding and freekilling a lot of people.\\nBlob - All the prisoners get in a blob and move around, whoever leaves the blob dies.\\nFollow the leader - A leader is appointed with a trivia question. Everyone follows the leader around. Every 10 seconds, the last person following the leader dies. Once 4 people are left, last reaction to last request.\\n\\n Map specific jailbreak games \\nPoolday - Prisoners go to pool. Simple as that.\\nProp hunt - Guards hide a prop somewhere. Prisoners look for the prop. Whoever finds it gets a prize.\\nSoccer day - Everyone goes to soccer. Prisoners vs guards. Can be full contact (punch whoever has the ball) or no contact.\\nInfirmary/Sauna/map specific room here day - Prisoners go to the <enter map specific room here> and do w/e they want. Usually ends up in rebellion."},{"postId":25790,"topicId":3244,"posterId":634,"postTime":1310963198,"postText":"Are pokemon days allowed?
