And his judgement on things seems to be just and fair. It doesn\'t seem to falter and any attacks against him he doesn\'t respond harshly or rudely (although he does often get angry, I\'ve never seen him just say \\"you\'re a faggot, thats all\\".\\n\\nBut, on the other hand, he is hated by many. This may affect how he moderates and such. Perhaps he holds grudges against certain members. Perhaps he abuses his powers to do things to them to get \\"even\\". We all know he has a temper, who knows how quickly his judgement will fall to his emotions."},{"postId":22092,"topicId":2754,"posterId":101,"postTime":1305658794,"postText":"When Ben is on: \\"Oh hi ben *laughlaughlaugh*\\nWhen Gash is on: *leaves*\\nWhen neither: \\"OMG _____ (usually Gash) is an abuser bitch bitch bitch bitch\\"\\n\\nSorry, just putting it how it is."},{"postId":22095,"topicId":2754,"posterId":4,"postTime":1305662371,"postText":"every other day when i\'m on with him he says something like \\"Yeah Gash just hates me and stuff but whatever\\""},{"postId":22125,"topicId":2754,"posterId":54,"postTime":1305677961,"postText":"i\'m gonna agree with Quack..
