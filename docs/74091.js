They get kicked off the bus for acting suspicious. They then precede to walk down the side of the highway. They both throw themselves into oncoming traffic. Neither are seriously injured. The police arrive and the women fight them off and fling themselves into traffic again. One is completely run over by a large truck and her leg practically explodes. The other is hit by a station wagon and is knocked unconscious. She later regains consciousness and again attempts to run into traffic, and it takes 6 people to restrain her. Both are finally transported to the hospital. The sister who was knocked unconscious sustains no injuries somehow, and is charged with assaulting a police officer and trespassing. She spends one night in jail and is released. The next day she stabs a random local man to death in his home. She flees with a hammer. A man drives by her and sees her running while bashing her head open with the hammer. he intervenes and she beats him over the head with a roof tile that she had in her pocket. Paramedics arrive and try to catch her. She flees and jumps off a 40 foot bridge onto the highway. She survives and is charged with murder, and has refused to answer any questions regarding any of this."},{"postId":13650,"topicId":1560,"posterId":101,"postTime":1294263885,"postText":"Jeez... that is fucking weird."},{"postId":13651,"topicId":1560,"posterId":3,"postTime":1294264427,"postText":"It\'s scientific.
