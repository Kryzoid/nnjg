I went to go take a piss and then I came back to my laptop and it was on the garry\'s mod menu (for some reason) and when I tried to connect to the server it said I was banned. I didn\'t do anything questionable. I never disconnected the server, which is strange. I can\'t tell who banned me obviously.
