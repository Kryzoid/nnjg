I think I\'m going to review every game I play, so prepare for a lot of reviews. On to the review.\\n\\n HOMEFRONT  - Made by  THQ \\n\\nHomefront is another FPS that takes place in the 2020\'s. During the opening scene, it describes what has happened between 2011 and 2023 (around 2023, I forgot the exact year in the 20\'s.) Since then, pretty much South Korea and North Korea united to become Unified Korea (I\'ll just refer to them as Korea), the oil supply has gotten low, and the Koreans EMP\'d the USA and all Hell is breaking loose. The Koreans are abusing Americans, killing innocents for no reason. It sets a good story up, but does it go through with it?\\n\\n  Campaign  \\n\\nIn the game, you play as Jacobs. Not much background is told about Jacobs, so you don\'t know your character very well. Apparently there is something special about you that the resistance (yeah, resistance. Original, huh?) needs, so they bust you out of the Koreans clutches. I won\'t tell much about the storyline - mostly because it is incredibly short (6 missions? What the fuck.) and nothing really happened. However, please note that  I only played up until the third mission , and you\'ll see why soon. Each mission takes about half an hour. In the missions, it doesn\'t seem like much is revealed.\\n\\nHowever, the campaign doesn\'t really interest me at all. THQ\'s tactic it seems is \\"Oh, let\'s just depress the player because no other games should do that!\'\'\'\' What the fuck THQ? The first scene, you are escorted on to a bus by the Koreans, and you get to watch first a black guy get beaten up (Real mature, THQ.), other people abused, and then the finale of the opening depression: A little kid crying while his parents say \\"Don\'t watch honey, just don\'t look. It\'ll be okay\\" and then they both get executed. The kid then runs up to them and cries some more, all while your bus just passes by. Of the whole part of the campaign I played, the only reason I wanted to keep playing was to avenge the kid. Later on the 2nd mission  *SPOILERS*  I am forced to jump into a pit filled with bodies that the Koreans killed just to hide from them. Later on the 3rd/4th mission, I see dead people who hung themselves off of a water tower. That isn\'t even a main attraction, I just happened to notice it. God knows what I missed. Also, in one section of the game a napalm airstrike set the enemies on fire, and they died a slow painful death. I got an achievement for NOT shooting them to end their lives even after the NPC that seems to care told me to.  *END SPOILERS* \\n\\n  MECHANICS/GAMEPLAY  \\nThe mechanics in the campaign are - to say at best - HORRID. In some parts where there is no fighting involved and I have to just walk somewhere, I move as SLOW AS A SNAIL and I have to wait for my teammates who are moving HALF AS SLOW AS ME. There\'s nothing even to look at either even though they told me I should. In the fighting sections of the game (the majority) they could sprint twice as fast as me. If I was ahead of them and I obviously had to crawl through a space, it would place an invisible wall there until they BOTH (there is usually 2 companions with you) got through. That goes with climbing ladders and opening doors too. Once when I was going inside, my NPC companion was talking to me. He was a good 5 feet through the doorway and an invisible wall stopped me from going through. It is REALLY annoying. Also, the NPCs get stuck. A lot. You have to nudge them a bit just to make them go. The controls are responsive luckily.\\n\\n  MULTIPLAYER  \\nThe multiplayer is just like every other multiplayer. Because I rented the game, I had to pay 800 microsoft points (10 dollars) if I wanted to rank up past level 5. The multiplayer is fairly bad, with only a few modes to play on. There is almost no point to do anything EXCEPT snipe unless you have to capture objectives. Sniping takes 2 shots to kill except for on headshots, which can be fairly annoying when sniping long range, considering all the guns have about no recoil. When you kill people you get these points, and after you get enough points you can get an RPG (useless.), some other explosives (useless.), flak jacket (useless), or vehicles/drones (OP and spammed.) The multiplayer was not enjoyable at all, and was a huge clusterfuck. I often died out of nowhere, didn\'t know what was going on, and other annoying-ass things. Not fun at all.\\n\\n  GOODS AND BADS  \\n -Good gun models\\n-Good story setup \\n -Nothing special\\n-Short campaign\\n-Clusterfuck multiplayer\\n-Not many guns\\n-Small text (This game is made for HD or something)\\n-Generally boring\\n-Very limited\\n-Overpowered vehicles in multiplayer\\n-Campaign often relies off of grenades\\n-\\"HERE BE GROSSED OUT AT THIS THAT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO FIGHT, RIGHT?\\"\\n-Characters have no personalities. \\n\\n\\n Verdict: 3.5 out of 10. Don\'t play this. It\'s shit. \\n\\nNext review: L.A. Noire."},{"postId":31557,"topicId":3819,"posterId":956,"postTime":1314824450,"postText":"Judging on the ratio of your good to bad things i probably wont get it now :l"},{"postId":31562,"topicId":3819,"posterId":634,"postTime":1314825328,"postText":"Good review Dum, I have played it and completely agree.
