( since about the 17th of december when i got banned ) So the reason why im seaking an unban is because from the point of ban i believe it was a little blown out of perportion however i realize anyone that remebers me will chime in on this thread so yea. Here goes nothing? Pretty much the only reasons for being banned kinda piled up and all exploded upon 1 rdm. I remeber the time very well it was around 9 pm CA time, There was 8 people in the server and Mr. Gash had been doing forums stuff and he was afk most the rounds. A few people died and there was 4 people left and i said alright i know im not the traitor and some1 else was proven inno so i asked that last remaining player if he was T and he said no so i said alright im killing Gash, however he was infact the traitor but was typing a message at the time so we saw his last words. That was the event in which got me the ban, however i realize alot of people had complained about me supposable hacking, as well as mass rdm. Which i protest both of which are false statements. The bottem line is i played the game propperly just had alot of cards stacking against me and therofor the smallest mistake caused me to recieve an \\"Unjust\\", If i may, perma ban. so yea. Please give me some feed back, i know this server has great potential and ive stayed close with alot of members from here. Hope i can join everyone soon =)"},{"postId":15533,"topicId":1849,"posterId":54,"postTime":1297231022,"postText":"I support you getting unbanned, you were always a good player."},{"postId":15534,"topicId":1849,"posterId":2,"postTime":1297232052,"postText":"I remember it as 5~some players on.

But realaisticly i was disliked because i played the server and didnt try to let the 11 year olds troll me so i trolled them back. I mean no one plays perfect, but i played and tryed help enforcing all the rules. I just want to try to help out the server. But come on everyone, without this being an insult to anyone, Gash we both know you have your share of rdms here and there. reguardless of who or of why. Everyone has. The only difference between me and your guys is that i dont have the power of admin to protect myself, in other words peoples complaints dont stack up against you all as they stack against myself."},{"postId":15625,"topicId":1849,"posterId":262,"postTime":1297361580,"postText":"Wow, Sweetwolf is a good player.\\n\\nHis judgment may have been bad, but he doesn\'t deserve a perm."},{"postId":15633,"topicId":1849,"posterId":39,"postTime":1297377698,"postText":"Gash, stop this bullshit.\\nFor starters, the 6 hour ban of That Guy was uncalled for.\\nIt seems to me you only permaban people for 1 RDM when they RDM you.\\nAnd I\'ve played with sweetwolf before.
