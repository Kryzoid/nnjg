I tried Black Ops and Assassin\'s Creed Brotherhood with them, and especially with Brotherhood, if someone is talking to you and you move the camera so that their position rotates around you on the screen, you will be able to hear the difference between their voice coming at you from in front of you on the right, or behind you on the left. Maybe it is some kind of virtual 7.1 surround sound type thing they did, but it works, and damn well at that. Please try something before you call it gimmicky shit.\\n\\nIn other news, Best Buy decided that they would accept it as a return, so yay."},{"postId":25369,"topicId":3185,"posterId":101,"postTime":1309996939,"postText":"DAMN IT I HAVE 30 DOLLARS NOW!!!!!"}]}')}}]);
