Sure, jizzta sucks but you can\'t do anything about it. Gaming: Less bugs, has all the pc games working for pc. Easier to play, better controls.\\n\\nMacs: Haven\'t been there much, a lot of bugs for gamers. Not all the games work, and most people will say \\"LOLMACFAGGOTGTFO\\" on a server if you use a mic. No right click, and a mouse costs like $50 if you don\'t want to use that shit pad that comes with the laptop. The HUGE other mac, desktop, is cool. Still doesn\'t have many games, and no right click. \\n\\nI say PC all the way."},{"postId":5338,"topicId":430,"posterId":1,"postTime":1281636299,"postText":"pc, macs have a mouse but it sucks and it sucks at gaming even when gmod comes otu for it i still give my vote to pc"},{"postId":5340,"topicId":430,"posterId":4,"postTime":1281636957,"postText":"THE DEAD HAS BEEN REVIVED, WE\'RE ALL GONNA DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\\n\\n\\n\\nlocked.\\nviolation of forum rule 9."}]}')}}]);
