If you\'re NEVER on, how can you be calling someone inactive when maybe it is you who is inactive? An inactive person cant judge who is also inactive, seeing as they\'re never on.\\n\\n\\nAnd I\'ve also been on, but I\'ve been on EVERY DAY until last week or so, when I excused my inactivity. \\n\\nThis summer, I gained 210 hours on garrysmod.

The rule that explains the conditions about following is that you must give 3 warnings, and Udane personally told me (before you banned him) that intelprop was following him even after giving the warnings, and Udane was also gathering proof to post a ban request on him for purposely doing this to make Udane shoot at him, resulting in karma loss.
