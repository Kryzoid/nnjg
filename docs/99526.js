I join the server, and spectating Connehh ( because he the only last 2 prisoners that still alive at the time ).\\n\\nThat time, Connehh got his LR. and he already said the LR. And a guard killed him. Eventually, on the next round, Connehh !slap 100 the guard.\\nLater on, there\'s a kid, named Clafair, saying \\" I WAS FREEKILLED \\" , but no sense because if you get killed, you cant speak using mic. Which means Clafair was lying, and this guy named Connehh, listen to Clafair request to !slap someone. Connehh did it. So, that\'s slap abuse because Connehh didn\'t check the console before executing commands.\\n\\nSo, I try to fix things up. I talked to Connehh so many time, and he muted me. After he muted me, he said he was  joking . - JOKING AND PLAYING AROUND WITH COMMANDS ? That\'s  ABUSE .\\n\\n http://www.500images.com/uploads/17139423621.png \\n\\nAfter all, I\'m don\'t have any intention to report this. But MZP.inferno says to me, report it.
