To sum it up quickly.\\n3 randomized rooms instead of one. An easier T tester, which when used by a Traitor, shows the opposite results (recently tricked 2 people who went in at the same time into thinking one was a T). 8 gatherable cubes, 1 floating cube stuck to a gun, 2 out of place cubes, and a hidden cube. A gun with a custom nnjg logo hologram in front of it, which when picked up, follows you, akin to the gun with a floating cube. A hidden room which has only one way in, no way out, and slowly kills you. And... of course, the cars have returned.\\nI realize some of you still think it\'s too big, but, to put it in scale, lost temple is actually about the same size from one end to the other.\\nOther then this \\"issue\\", comments would be appreciated in the possible case of confused peice 3 in the future."},{"postId":31426,"topicId":3873,"posterId":364,"postTime":1314712866,"postText":"Sohisohi hugs you ^.^"},{"postId":31438,"topicId":3873,"posterId":634,"postTime":1314730183,"postText":"Nice work, I really like it, for piece 3 throw in some major junctions with high ledges around it for push-kill/falling hilarity.\\n\\nalso, is the hidden cube the one with your avatar on it?"},{"postId":31456,"topicId":3873,"posterId":605,"postTime":1314742822,"postText":">> also, is the hidden cube the one with your avatar on it? \\nNo, thats one of the 2 out of place cubes"},{"postId":31574,"topicId":3873,"posterId":956,"postTime":1314828623,"postText":"I am looking forward on playing it :3"},{"postId":31903,"topicId":3873,"posterId":735,"postTime":1315026251,"postText":"How about the borders are a push-able traitor button for 1 credit? 1 credit= the borders falling"},{"postId":31909,"topicId":3873,"posterId":605,"postTime":1315030955,"postText":">> How about the borders are a push-able traitor button for 1 credit? 1 credit= the borders falling \\nThis came across my mind, but sadly, the button they scripted doesnt actually require a credit, so it can be activated even with 0 creds.. but activitating it with a credit still would take one away.\\nInstead, i\'m thinking about having it a trap activatable once every 4 minutes, one per side."},{"postId":32021,"topicId":3873,"posterId":605,"postTime":1315108797,"postText":"changelog from b2-b3;\\nmade skybox higher per multiple request (you still cant get on the roof of the middle high room)\\nadded a T button to two sides of the area aimbot mentioned, each can be used only once per 4 minutes, you dont get credit for the kills made by this trap (trigger_push seems unable to be linked to damagelogs)\\nadded a T button in the middle of the map that allows one T to claim all the kills made by the cars and the secret room (this includes the loss of points for another T getting ran over)\\nchanged the form of one of the easter eggs from a lone purple cube to a smiley face made of cubes (so people may understand that it is an easter egg)\\nchanged the hentai cube\'s image (not all the other anime ones... theres a different between hentai and anime ;~;)"}]}')}}]);
