I understand all of the rules and have sympathy with players who do not understand them, I do my best to explain how jailbreak works.\\n7) How did you find out about NNJG: I was looking for a Jailbreak server ever since GH Jail and NNJG was better.\\n8) How long have you been involved with NNJG and/or Shadow\'s servers: Since May 2011\\n9) How long have you been a registered user on Steam: I think at least 2 to 3 years\\n10) What you can bring to the NNJG Team: As I am on a different time zone to I think most members of staff, I will be able to be on the server when other moderators cannot. \\n11) Why do you want to be part of the NNJG Team: I believe I can bring a lot to NNJG and Jailbreak.\\n12) Do you have any past experience with the position you\'re applying for: I have had a lot of experience with ULX, and have been Moderator / Admin of several servers. I have also been a VIP on this server for quite some time.\\n13) Have you ever posted a ban request, and if so, was it accepted: I have posted a ban request on a user once a little while ago for being very disrespectful. It was accepted.\\n14) How often do you play on an NNJG server: I play Jail very frequently on weekends, but on weekdays, mainly in the evening.\\n15) Do you own a decent microphone, and do you frequently utilize it: Yes, I do own a good microphone and use it a lot.\\n16) How fast/well can you type: About 88 WPM if I tryed. I tend not to abbreviate words and make sure everyone can understand me if I was typing.\\n17) What is your favorite and least favorite aspect of NNJG: My favourite aspect of NNJG would have to be it\'s great staff, I have made quite a few friends since joining the server, also most of the players on the server are very friendly. My least favourite aspect of NNJG would have to be Jailbeak\'s downtime, but since it\'s been up for a while lately I\'m hoping its problem is solved.\\n18) Any other comments or information you can provide: I would really like to be a member of your staff as I am frequently called into the server, in replacement of a moderator, as there isn\'t usually one on. In some cases I can help but in others (Such as trolls) a votekick cannot rid the problem. I would be a very active member of staff.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\nhttp://imageshack.us/g/59/aimbotl.png/\\n(14 there)\\nhttp://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/818/vasto.png/\\n(1 here)"}]}')}}]);
