First, mabe something like a poison shot instead of a drug shot should be added for the prisoners. Or mabe even the prisoners can spawn with a dartgun! But only one dart for the dartgun, because I think it should be a one hit kill! Or mabe even a molotov cocktail can be added to the server. This is what I think would be cool! :)     Oh, and if possible, can someone plz add more upgrades to the shop? Thank you! ;)"},{"postId":18039,"topicId":2241,"posterId":521,"postTime":1301358487,"postText":"1hit kill\\nThats nuts"},{"postId":18072,"topicId":2241,"posterId":569,"postTime":1301431627,"postText":">> 1hit kill\\nThats nuts \\nLol, ya I guess that is nuts."},{"postId":18099,"topicId":2241,"posterId":569,"postTime":1301512921,"postText":"Other than that, can I know what everyone else thinks?"},{"postId":18131,"topicId":2241,"posterId":521,"postTime":1301572228,"postText":"The molotov cocktail one would be nice if it acted as an incendiary"},{"postId":18904,"topicId":2241,"posterId":595,"postTime":1302731598,"postText":"I think It\'d be sweet.
