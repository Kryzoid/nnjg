On our Jailbreak server, prisoners already spawn with them.. \\nI watched a video series a year ago by World Of Level Design that taught me how to make custom L4D campaigns. Once I got around with the editor after a few months, I fell in love with how Hammer works. I\'ve been mapping randomly time to time, but this is actually the first serious time I\'ve tried to map.\\n\\n>> Also, any chance the skybox can be changed to a different sky? \\nIf I can find a less depressing skybox, it will change.\\n\\n>> >> On our Jailbreak server, prisoners already spawn with them.. \\nOnly VIPs and higher ranked players spawn with knives.\\n\\n@Sonata: If this is just meant for our Jailbreak server, it\'s best to not include weapons on the map itself, as our gamemode code has the ability to let admins place the weapons where they see fit. Yeah, I was wondering how that worked. So I don\'t have to worry about placing the weapons and food. :P I\'ll probably change the kitchen to some other purpose if we\'re not going to leave knives in there. (Probably a vent.)"}]}')}}]);
