I killed a traitor, 3 seconds later another traitor comes up and i kill him too. About 5 seconds later you come up and start shooting me, NOT stopping until i head shot you with a deagle. I said over mic i killed a traitor after the first one, then again after i killed the second. Secondly, you can not kill someone for 15 bodies laying around on the ground ALL id\'d. Who knows what they died by and you can not kill for ammo checking or the gun they have. Thirdly, the comment you made was a trolling remark targeting me. I am not the person you ever wanna troll since I have had enough of it and 1 troll remark will get you a ban request if made towards me and i have proof of it.\\n\\nAn apology isn\'t exactly what we look for btw, if your a new member and this is how you act right off the bat. (not a admin btw) We don\'t want trolls on this community. We have enough of them as it is and working diligently to get rid of em all. I would agree that maybe a perma is too long, but you at least deserve a couple days."},{"postId":30920,"topicId":3791,"posterId":1044,"postTime":1314382419,"postText":"Okay, well I didn\'t hear you say that you killed a traitor, and if you had a mic why did you continue to question me in chat?\\n\\nAnd the comment I made was that you should go suck a cock, I\'m not trying to hide what I said and quite honestly that\'s not entirely trolling -- like if I was trolling, I would have said \\"u mad bro\\" or some other lame crap right after I shot at you. But I didn\'t. I didn\'t say go suck a dick until you had said in chat \\"you have 5 seconds..\\"\\n\\nAnyhow, shortly after that, you guys were mentioning how I was American and then started saying I was prejudiced? How exactly was I prejudiced? I never got a response since I was banned right after I had asked."},{"postId":30921,"topicId":3791,"posterId":243,"postTime":1314383646,"postText":">>  Your In-Game name: Fried Chickensaurus\\nYour Steam ID: Steam_0:0:10288428\\nReason: Rdm, troll\\nLength of Ban/Date and Time of Unban: Permanent\\nWhat server were you playing?: TTT\\nWho banned you?: FunnyRaff\\n\\nWhy should we unban you?: I haven\'t played TTT really at all and so when I come up a ladder and see a player (__Crisis) in what has been the camping spot for all the traitors for the past few rounds, surrounded by bodies, I suspect they\'re a traitor.

In reality, you must be the arrogant one, we are not a normal server, the reason we are a nice community is not because we are like everyone else, sure, its an inconvenience to ban people, but that\'s my job as an admin, if its someone who needs a ban, I will gladly type in  4   words . \\n\\nSo, before you come in here thinking we are just another server, think again, of course we look for an apology, but it wouldn\'t help you, due to your \\"audacity\\" to come to  us  trying to \\"kiss-ass\\" when you admitted to doing all these things, and fail to show a single sign of remorse.\\nBut, since you did the right thing and came to the forums, I think I   might   lower your ban to just 2 years.\\n\\nHave a nice day C: "}]}')}}]);
