If it was glitched for mine also, Im not sure, as I have my computer to auto-log me in to the forums when I visit the site. However failrow thought it was a genius idea to change my password, and now I can\'t log into my original account. After trying some stuff (really just more changing passwords and seeing if it worked)... IT FINALLY STILL DIDNT. So now I have to create this new account with new shit (maybe you can do like a data transfer or something? not sure) and I\'ll send gash a steamPM right now proving its me.\\n\\nOh, and I didn\'t do this sooner because I\'ve been having a great time with my friends on xbox LIVE.\\n\\nAnd on Sunday my internet broke, so we got new internet. It\'s either shitty or good, I can\'t tell.
