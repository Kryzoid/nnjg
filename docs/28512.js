While I know the punishment decision is up to that staff member themselves, I would like some feedback on proper and accepted punishment methods, along with the right actions to take.I understand there\'s no way to cover EVERY single situation that\'s possible in TTT, but this would help greatly.\\n\\nHow many times do I ask a player their reasoning for doing something before slaying them? So far I\'ve been typing it twice and usually asking once over the mic. But I\'ve AT LEAST always asked over text.\\n\\nSomething that really confuses me, that tends to happen alot is if a Player X RDM\'s Player Y over , and Player says \\"Don\'t slay X, it\'s fine\\". Do I slay X, or not?\\n\\nHow many times should a person be slayed, say for attempted RDM, till a ban. I would say one to two, if after the first slay he didn\'t make it blatantly obvious he was RDM\'ing.\\n\\nMisinterpreted situations. Player 1 suicides in front of Player 2. Player 3 sees the body in front of Player 2 and kills him. Do I slay Player 3 for not ID\'ing the body first, or not because he was on or with an UNID\'d?\\n\\nThis happened twice today. Player W was with Player Z. Player W fell of the building, on his own accord, but had Player Z in his last words as \\"I\'m with Player Z. *SPLUT*\\". Then Player Z would be called out and killed. But do I slay Player W for false accusing, even though it was accidental?\\n\\nGoomba Stomping. Alot of the times it is accidental, especially on Dev_town. Should I slay for Goomba Stomps, even when they are obviously accidental?\\n\\nWhen I see someone had thrown an incendiary as an innocent, or randomly crow-barred, I will warn them to refrain from doing so. But how many times does it take for random crow barring/random incendiaries to become a problem? \\n\\nThis can kind of go with the above. But when I see a small strip of damage that looks like a random shot/random incendiary/random crowbar, I ask that person the reason for the damage, and if they admit to it being random or don\'t respond I would slap that person for the damage they did to that player, in my opinion. Or is it better to just slay that person?\\n\\nThis happened yesterday. Player A pushed Player B into the traitor room entrance on temple with a crowbar. Player B killed player A just for pushing him in there, not even attempting to press the button or such. I slayed Player B being he killed A on really no basis. Was I wrong?\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry for all this, I can see how lately I\'ve really wanted to confirm like everything, but I just want to moderate the server in the most fair and proper way I can, and so far these situations have boggled me. I appreciate the feedback."},{"postId":34005,"topicId":4267,"posterId":153,"postTime":1316643341,"postText":"I made this,\\nNoone else caught on but I still think this would be a good idea.\\nCheck it out.\\nhttp://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3735"},{"postId":34007,"topicId":4267,"posterId":735,"postTime":1316643714,"postText":">> Ben\\":20byu69g]I made this,\\nNoone else caught on but I still think this would be a good idea.\\nCheck it out.\\nhttp://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3735 \\nMost of theses are a bit too light, but, seeing that most of the rdmers and trolls that just come on here wont come back it may be ok."},{"postId":34008,"topicId":4267,"posterId":812,"postTime":1316643851,"postText":">> Ben\\":1vfpioqn]I made this,\\nNoone else caught on but I still think this would be a good idea.\\nCheck it out.\\nhttp://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3735 \\nOkay, Thank you Ben I\'ll be looking into that.
