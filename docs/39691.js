Just ideas, probably not possible to implement some \\n\\nTraitor\\n_____________________\\n Prop bomb - Turns any prop into a timed explosive of about 1min. Makes a loud beeping sound, so innocents can hear it. \\n Proximity mine - Placed behind a door or out of sight, these explode when someone gets within, say, 10 feet of them. Lets say it does 50 damage. \\nParachute - Makes you fall slowly in the air toward the ground when equipped. You fall slowly, so you\'re vulnerable to shots if someone sees you.\\n Jammer - Stops voice chat or severely messes it up in a 50 foot radius. Works through walls. \\n Lock - When placed on a door, the door locks. Maybe turning into a destructible prop that you have to shoot to break open. comes with 2 charges. \\nZ-virus - Turns dead bodies into zombies. Neutral hostile zombies.\\nPoison gas grenade - Covers the immediate area in poison gas, slowly killing anyone inside it and leaving a 10 second damage over time effect when you leave it.\\nExplosive charge - Like the C4, but with a detonator that you control and a WAAAAAY smaller blast radius.\\nFacepaint - Go to an unided body, left click, wait 5 seconds for a little progress bar to fill up, and the body is unrecognizable. Like the flaregun but silent, and you\'re vulnerable while disguising the body.\\n  Traitor ink - A spray can that sprays a red line over walls and stuff, only traitors can see it. Useful for leaving other traitors messages about the scene at hand. \\nFake ID - Click on a body and it shows that body is ID\'\'ed for about 60 sec, after that it returns to an unidentified body.\\nBlack hole emulator - When shot it creates a poltergeist-like object that attracts all props in a 30 yard radius to it for, say, 15 sec.\\n Sapper - Click a health station with this and it disables/destroys the health station. \\nBackpack - Able to carry an extra primary weapon in slot 7\\nHolster - Able to carry an extra secondary weapon in slot 7\\n Reinforced crowbar/traitor crowbar - Looks like normal crowbar, except has 4x damage and 2x push force. \\nTracking chip - Takes 5 seconds of a person standing still to put it in them, and you can track them everywhere for a set time. \\n\\nDetective\\n_____________________\\n Beacon - Placeable beacon that shows one of those DNA squares(where when you have the scanner and theres a little square over the person that your DNA matches with) but with a giant B or a red mark. In this way, a detective could get all the innocents to one area. Traitors can see it too, though. \\nCommunal board - Where you press E and it brings up a version of the tab menu where you can mark people as dead/missing/kos and it shows how many people think that under the persons name. Like if 5 people knew mzp.dante was dead, it would show his name, a \\"DEAD\\" tag and 5 tallies.\\n Weapon scanner - Scans a player for weapons, takes 5 seconds of them standing still in melee range\\n Resupply crate - Gives you a clip of your current weapon\'s ammo when you press E on it. has 20 charges. \\n Cracked radio - Allows you to listen in on traitor voice chat for a set time. Does not show player names. (This could be useless because some people will recognize eachothers voice) \\nRope - Allows you to hang bodies "},{"postId":17987,"topicId":2235,"posterId":112,"postTime":1301317484,"postText":"We tried the jammer and it didnt work, the beacon just sounds like a detective enforced jihad trap.
