Terraria basically is like a ripoff of Minecraft, but with new stuff to do, and more possibilities and easier on computer hardware. This game has all the makings of a competitor to Minecraft and easily cheaper to compared to $20 to fork out to play Minecraft, which Terreria is only $9.99 (no taxes due to being sold digitally). Terreria is basically a Role playing game (which everyone should know by now) and uses a health system that is easily understandable which you don\'t have to make food, but instead explore for food. In order to survive you have to have special equipment to beat bigger enemies (by bigger I mean 250+ hp enemies), and is easy to understand to those who are just joining the RP community and a great game for the young ones. All things considered I give it, on a five point system, a 4 out of 5, due to it being easy to understand, great for first timers on the RP community, easy on the computer while looking great graphics, and Replay value.\\n\\nThis game can be found on the Steam Store at the link below:\\n http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/ "},{"postId":23901,"topicId":3005,"posterId":605,"postTime":1307965717,"postText":"I too would recomend this game. It feels like a game like minecraft more focused on exploring and combat over building. Much like minecraft, to get stronger you have to get better ore to make better gear.

In addition, there are bosses with hp in the thousands.\\nThough on a point i\'d disagree, the game does get harder then cappiman makes it sound.
