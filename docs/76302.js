Alpha Protocol is an espionage rpg, from a third person perspective, it features dialogue options similar to the mass effect games, and perks similar to fallout (except you get them for doing certain things, not by choosing them when you level up) their are many ways to tackle a mission: stealth, run in guns blazing, or be geek, not nerd, and hack through terminals and beat up the bad guys. Despite the horrible reviews i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs, third-person shooters, or sex scenes. I would give this game a 7/10 (If you focus on stealth the boss fights are nigh impossible though)"},{"postId":36106,"topicId":4616,"posterId":237,"postTime":1319321301,"postText":"I like it too, and it runs pretty well, except my camera gets choppy sometimes, but that\'s probably my non-gaming rig."}]}')}}]);
