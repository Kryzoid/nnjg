You should play this. The map is very detailed. It doesn\'t have any pop up scare things(cheap scares), but it does give you a felling that the map hates you. The lack of light also brings the scare factor, you feel like something is waiting to jump at you, but it\'s only the darkness sitting there. I have yet to complete the map myself."},{"postId":28125,"topicId":3516,"posterId":2,"postTime":1312775008,"postText":"The map requires too many downloads in my opinion."},{"postId":28156,"topicId":3516,"posterId":612,"postTime":1312792650,"postText":"We have this map. \\n\\nCatacombs. \\n\\nDark, scary, hates you"}]}')}}]);
