That way hp upgrades serve another purpose having it at 2000 dmg brings noskill shit to the game, And all the complainers about Karma being lower u dont 1 shot ppl without hp upgrades. Thats irrelavent if ur karma is lower then its ur own fault and u deserve not to 1 shot someone. Reply If you agree the knife should be 100dmg not 2000!

If you have a crowbar and you\'re behind someone, try throwing it into the crowd from there, and after (This works well if you have a \\"lastinv\\" bind) switch to your crowbar, then make sure you\'re seen switching to your primary weapon, but don\'t start shooting unless someone does first.
