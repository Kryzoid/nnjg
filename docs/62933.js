At the end of the round a player inquired as to the song that played if it was from Inspector Gadget.  I began humming to the tune when an admin by the name of Udane told me not to sing on microphone.  I stopped immediately and went on playing when not long after I heard Largo singing the same song.  I began to tell him to stop singing or he was going to get muted when Udane not only muted Largo but myself.  When I asked why I was muted he said, \\"For trolling.\\"  What?!  I inquired further and he said I was trolling in my tone of how I told Largo to stop singing.  I was unmuted the next round, but Largo remained muted.  We played a few rounds and I saw Largo typing out that he was never given a warning.  Udane\'s reasoning was that he should have heard the warning he gave to myself, but Largo claimed he did not hear the warning.  I began to talk to the admin in admin chat, trying to reason with him-- respectfully mind you.  Udane assumed that Largo was trolling, and because of that, muted him.  He also assumed I was trolling by telling Largo not to sing (I\'m not quite clear on how that is still, though, to be honest).  He then informed us that it is not my place to judge whether or not someone is trolling.  Largo then accused Udane that he was being a troll admin.  After that, I didn\'t read or type anything else.  I had tried to reason with him, and I just wanted to play the round that had just started.  And that\'s what I did until I was suddenly banned.  I typed immediately to Largo, telling him I was banned.  He informed me that I was banned for \\"trolling\\".  He quickly followed me in a ban.\\n\\nI\'ll reiterate that we were being respectful to the admin.  He made assumptions about us, and when he found out that we were friends he assumed that not only were we trolls but we were organized trolling.  Or that\'s the only rational explanation I can think of. \\n\\nI posted as accurate of an account as possible, and it seems rather clear that this admin is abusive.\\n\\nEdit: I apologize, I didn\'t use the correct template.\\n1) Which server:  TTT\\n2) Your in-game name: Windmill111111\\n3) Your SteamID: \\n4) When were you banned and for how long: Unknown\\n5) Reason for ban: Unknown\\n6) Who banned you: Udane\\n7) Why should we unban you or shorten your ban period: Was banned without cause."},{"postId":37020,"topicId":4767,"posterId":1175,"postTime":1320303200,"postText":"All of the above is true. All of what -I- said in my thread before this one was posted is true. If Udane touches this, he\'s truly the troll. I never meant to incite anything negatory... Udane incited it. If he has any screenshots to back up his own claims, let him, since he hasn\'t brought any before me."},{"postId":37022,"topicId":4767,"posterId":1176,"postTime":1320306496,"postText":"I just read that Udane denied an unban request of a player (Largo) that he banned.  I don\'t know how this appears to others, but that seems rather unfair.  He muted us, banned us and is now denying our unban requests.  I don\'t think I\'m being unreasonable when I\'m asking for admin intervention-- let me clarify, -another- admin to intervene."},{"postId":37028,"topicId":4767,"posterId":605,"postTime":1320317429,"postText":"All right, i\'ll humor you, if gash/ben himself posts on this topic within the next day or 2 about how I was wrong, we can assume I was wrong. If not, you were not even worth his time to argue against, and as thus, deserve your ban. This being said, if he sends me a steam message to lock this topic and ignore yall, I will do so."},{"postId":37043,"topicId":4767,"posterId":2,"postTime":1320354724,"postText":"After taking a look at the logs, I\'m going to shorten Windmill\'s ban to one week."}]}')}}]);
