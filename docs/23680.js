I had killed him once because he was not in the pool.\\nUnfortunately as my video decided not to record sound I have no further evidence you are still welcome to view it though as, it clearly shows Vasto joining in about the first 20 seconds or so, and I am sure he heard most of the rather unpleasant comments from Uiik.\\nVideo: http://www.xfire.com/video/4994b7/\\n\\nI would hope to see h_ten banned for this, but I doubt Uiik will be as my evidence on him is weak.
