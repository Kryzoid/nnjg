If your thread has been made before the date I said in the other thread, then it will be attended to. But if not, you\'re going to have to wait a couple days for me to fix some things.\\n\\nMost things are just for the TTT server, and Zombie Survival server that I need to fix.\\n\\nLike for the TTT, I might need some help coding for that one. And I need ideas for what you get if you\'re VIP on the Zombie Survival server.\\n\\n If you make a topic before I am finished with these things in the Staff Applications section, the link to this thread will be posted and it will be locked until these problems are fixed. Please be patient, but if you donate you will receive VIP done or not.  "}]}')}}]);
