Also, it isn\'t martyrdom. \\n\\nOk. Take a landmine. Preferably a bouncing betty. Basically looks like a can of tuna but bigger, with a shaft protruding from the centre. Now, as a traitor, you buy this mine, it takes up whichever weapon slot. Upon death, you drop the landmine. A skull and crossbones appears over the landmine only on other traitors screens. Now, IF anyone happens to step right ontop of this landmine, it will make the sound of a rusty spring creaking into place with a loud click at the end. If you move at the end of this 2 second soundplay, it will jump up to chest height, and explode. Alternatively, you can have it launch knives or something like that, however they should launch 45 degrees downward so they can\'t smack a guy 25 feet away. Knives also give the possibility of surviving the mine because the farther the knives fly from the mine, the bigger of a gap between each knife will be. \\n\\n\\nTrip-wire trap: A super knifty trap that is awesome for covering your ass if you\'re in pursuit, or great to lure inno\'s into. Basically, it requires two walls no farther apart from eachother than 7 feet, you stick it to the wall like c4 at ankle height, anyone walks through the \\"string\\" and boom. Pretty simple really, the name defines itself, honestly. Just get a cube geometry, texture it black, attach a clothes line geometry and a grenade geometry to that shit, apply a white texture to the clothes line geometry and make it\'s opacity such that it looks thinner (60% opacity?) and voila, code in an explosion and explosion trigger system in lua and BAM. You got a trip wire.\\n\\n\\nDummy Decoy: A fake corpse. Coded to allow you to put whoevers name, cause of death, special equipment, affiliation (Traitor, Detective, Innocent) etc on it for searching, you drop it somewhere and piss off. Great for making people think you\'re dead, or framing people. I\'d suggest fake DNA, that is just unscannable, but shows up on the corpse for 2 min. Also last words and last seen\'d be sick too."},{"postId":36615,"topicId":4691,"posterId":1061,"postTime":1319780544,"postText":"2nd idea Similar to Kryzoids Idea with The Banana\\nDummy Decoy i think its already Suggested\\nthe First one i didnt understand at all"},{"postId":36619,"topicId":4691,"posterId":605,"postTime":1319781934,"postText":"Basically, his \\"CHEID\\" idea is a t weapon, that whenever you die, activates, and drops a bomb in your location, that whenever a player gets close to, explodes.\\nIf it was changed so that the bomb automatically explodes around 5 seconds after your death, I would love it. Though, we may need to tweak the distances shorter else its an easier jihad in a sense.\\n\\n2nd idea has been suggest nearly 50 times (truthfully around 3 or 4 times) already. If I recall, it was deemed op/too easy to troll or something. ;~;\\nAlso, its nothing like the \\"banana\\" kry suggested. Banana=altering of the jihad producing ragdolls everywhere, while this suggestion is basically a trip mine.\\n\\nThe last idea is somewhat similar to one of the previous suggestions somewhere, but instead, you are spawning your own ragdoll. I\'d rather have the ability to fake your own death with a temporary death pill over planting a body and hoping no one sees the real me."},{"postId":36623,"topicId":4691,"posterId":373,"postTime":1319789090,"postText":"By God it\'s like your TRYING to put the martydom perk into TTT..\\n\\nLike Udane said, it\'s been denied already.\\n\\nThe last idea is something everyone wants and agrees with.
