I know a lot of the playerbase, I am more closely affiliated with the TTT server, but I still know a good amount of Jailbreak regulars and I believe I can bring a more professional environment to jail with moderator. \\n7) How did you find out about NNJG:  Random Server Jumping led to the TTT server. \\n8) How long have you been involved with NNJG and/or Shadow\'s servers:   Since late February, 2011 I think, perhaps longer. \\n9) How long have you been a registered user on Steam:  February 1st, 2010 \\n10) What you can bring to the NNJG Team:  Moderation \\n11) Why do you want to be part of the NNJG Team:  I would like to help NNJG in any way possible. \\n12) Do you have any past experience with the position you\'re applying for:  VIP experience on Jail. \\n13) Have you ever posted a ban request, and if so, was it accepted:  Yes \\n14) How often do you play on an NNJG server:  I play NNJG all the time, my Jailbreak playtime is much lower than TTT and if mod. I would play more often on Jailbreak. \\n15) Do you own a decent microphone, and do you frequently utilize it:  Yes \\n16) How fast/well can you type:  My spelling is sometimes rather mediocre and I can type at a fairly average speed. \\n17) What is your favorite and least favorite aspect of NNJG:  My favorite part of NNJG is the community and my least favorite part is the community-drama  and the sausage infestation  \\n18) Any other comments or information you can provide:  My original and still main goal is to become a TTT moderator. I will be blunt about the fact that I do enjoy the TTT server more. I do, however, think that I can moderate very well on any server and will devote the time required to Jail, and be prompt about any request made by a Jailbreak player whether I am on or off the Jailbreak server. \\n\\nRecommendations\\n http://i877.photobucket.com/albums/ab332/Destar_01/NNJG/15jailreccos.png "}]}')}}]);
