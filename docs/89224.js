For example: Right now, they\'re selling a region free  Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad  for only   26.99 Dollars!   And if you like their facebook page, you get a promo code which will bump the price down to like 25 bucks. And that\'s nothing!  Warhammer 40k Space Marines is like 30 EFFING DOLLERS.   I just wanted to post about it. Ben, or gash, please don\'t ban me if this post is not allowed. But i\'m pretty sure it is. Tell me or remove it if it\'s not. You guys would miss out on alot. The site IS legit. You can ask me. I bought Deus Ex HR for like 35 bucks. Now it\'s like 32 something dollars and with a promo itl go down to 31.\\n\\nHere is the site: http://www.ultimatumgamekeys.com/\\n\\nAnd here is their Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/UltimatumGames.net (Like for a promo code)\\n\\nAnd here\'s a whole bunch of customer reviews: http://www.trustpilot.com/review/ultimatumgamekeys.com\\n\\nAnd yes. They are legit like i said. You can ask people that have bought from them such as myself. The keys are all legit and not stolen. Ask around!\\n\\n\\nALSO: BE SURE TO LOOK FOR (REGION FREE) IF YOU DON\'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF ACTIVATING THROUGH A VPN <-------------------\\n\\nTransaction is through paypal and they email you the code REALLY FAST with no hassle unless you live in america and you got the russian version. Which then they activate it through a VPN. But like i said LOOK FOR (REGION FREE)\\n\\nIt is legal and the keys are legal. Google is your friend! look at the customer reviews"},{"postId":33528,"topicId":4210,"posterId":812,"postTime":1316380508,"postText":"Seems legit, nice find.
