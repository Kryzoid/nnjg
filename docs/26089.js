If you stop bashing overclocking. \\nYOU STILL REMEMBER THAT.....sheesh. I just read it from my college book don\'t be mad at me just putting what I learned into practice. \\n\\nThe reason why I asked it is that I would like to host a 24 hour TF2 server only for Bucknell University Students (which is where I work, uh oh NOT GOOD) and any money that is given torwards this even or if students and employees pays will go to a non-profit charity (ie relay for life) this thing in general is called a game-a-thon kinda like a marathon but without sweat (depending on how the gamer is) and plus it would help getting your name out and it is a F2P game that anyone (with steam) can download. The game systems I am looking into would be Xbox360 nintendo wii (haha tennis elbow) and PS3."},{"postId":31864,"topicId":3920,"posterId":252,"postTime":1315018159,"postText":"When do you need this hosted?"},{"postId":33354,"topicId":3920,"posterId":754,"postTime":1316152206,"postText":">> When do you need this hosted? \\n\\nWell I was plan on having a 24 hour non-stop video game event for a charity of my work\'s choosing but completely shot it down so never mind\\n\\nps. admin please lock :3"}]}')}}]);
