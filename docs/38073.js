He continued to drag this on until there were only a couple minutes left in the round, opens the door, and dm\'s an innocent (he was innocent too).\\n\\nI was banned for 1 minute for \\"rdm/ghosting\\" after I killed 1 person, a terrorist, after I found him, by the body, with a half empty m16, which was the murder weapon, and him being the only person in the server without a primary weapon. After I warned the server via voice (if chat is logged, you can see evidence of that there too). Upon returning after my short departure, he proceeded to accuse me of untrue statements.\\n\\nHe also repremanded several players for rtv\'ing during a round, then after he died, rtv\'d himself to change the map so he could spawn. Before map change, I checked the scoreboard to find me and several other LEGIT players, at 1000 karma. Kryzoid had dropped to an astounding 400 upon rdm\'ing so many people in past rounds.\\n\\nAfter the map was changed to cs_office, he continued his usual antics of \\"shoot first ask questions later\\". Eventually when someone accused him of being a traitor, got slapped for 100 damage and killed instantly.\\n\\n\\nDuring all of this action, I was player named \\"Soap McTavish\\", but I have played on the server several times before under E-104 Epsilon.

RDM is, as the acronym implies, random. A person or persons using reason to determine that you are guilty is not at all random. This was simply rageing with admin powers.\\n\\nThe \\"I CAN CLAIM A ROOM\\" thing doesn\'t work. A terrorist can easily \\"claim a room\\" and kill whoever they please and not be at all guilty, but if a person attempts to kill them or interveine because they\'ve killed people, it\'s instantly regarded as RDM. This completely throws off and imbalances the game unfairly. Eventually you would have everyone camping a room and using any justification they can to get away with whatever they did. The room claiming is as random as it gets. Anyone could come into an area, not knowing someone had claimed it, and boom! They\'re dead. Randomly.\\n\\nI never saw any evidence that Soap ghosted.

Nobody is perfect, but you did remember the rule twice before, and I find it an odd coincidence that you forget about the rule when you want to rtv, shortly after your death.

I\'m going to clarify some rules that were causing confusion. However, before I do this,  I\'m going to note some things.\\n 1) It was my mistake for typing Admin on our steam page. I haven\'t updated that in a while.\\n 2) Kryzoid is a mod for a reason. He was made a mod because we felt he could handle the position.\\n 3) On picture 4, you said Kryzoid slapped the detective, killing him. If you read the text above, you would note Kryzoid killed a traitor, and the detective killed him.  Much time passed after that, and the detective killed Kryzoid. THAT IS RDM. An innocent killing a traitor is NOT a reason to kill someone. The detective was slain, for RDMing, as would anyone else who RDM\'d.  \\n 4) This Thread WILL remain locked to avoid unnecessary arguing, however I strongly suggest you read over all the rules here AND on the motd(accessible by tyiping !motd in chat). Here are some clarifications: \\nRoom Claiming IS Allowed. Small Rooms only. You may give a warning to someone to leave the room, and if they don\'t you may kill them, after a warning IS given.\\nYou may NOT rtv during a round. If someone does, a message will be broadcast to all players telling them not to nominate/rtv. If anyone does after the warning is given, they will be kicked.\\nRacism is a one day ban. This rule is not well known, however should and will be enforced more, starting now.\\nRDM is an automatic slay. It\'s up to mods or admins to determine what was and wasn\'t RDM. Their judgement is final. If you RDM, you will be given ONE warning. If you continue to RDM, you will be banned, time depending on how much you RDM.\\nWe used to have an under 500 Karma = kick rule, but I don\'t know what happened to that. I will converse with the other owners about this and get back to you guys on that one. PLEASE READ THESE RULES WELL. ANY OTHER ABUSE BY PLAYERS MAY BE SENT TO http://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/bans  ."}]}')}}]);
