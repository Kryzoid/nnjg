Prisoners spawn with hands/fists, special weapons MAYBE! It\'s the Guards job to keep order, they have guns and power of authority.\\nThe guards having 8 players is enough, it only matters if there\'s a fucking warden giving order or else it\'s chaos.  If there\'s a good warden the guards\'ll win 31 to 40 \\nif there is someone running the place.  (This, also, was with me being a badass warden. Jus\'\' saying.)\\n\\nHellz also isn\'t the problem, it\'s the fail guards giving pool days/not doing a damn thing every day. It gives the prisoners a chance to run around shooting up the place.\\nMost regulars stick to prisoner because most of the time, the prisoners do win. But I encourage them to become a guard and do the team justice.\\n\\nCave Johnson, we\'re done here."},{"postId":21277,"topicId":2654,"posterId":695,"postTime":1304920758,"postText":" http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/e/e6/Okay_guy.jpg "},{"postId":21279,"topicId":2654,"posterId":740,"postTime":1304924610,"postText":"Lol!. :D"},{"postId":21280,"topicId":2654,"posterId":695,"postTime":1304925289,"postText":" http://www.gapingvoid.com/now%20what.jpg "},{"postId":21344,"topicId":2654,"posterId":101,"postTime":1304978150,"postText":"Honestly, if your post doesn\'t contribute, don\'t say it.
