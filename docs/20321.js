Some of these screenshots are from months ago. The fact that admins are in some of the damage logs shows that I probably did not break a rule or i was already punished for it. Damage isnt the only reason for killing someone. People are killed all the time for running past unideds, staying with someone that is kos, calling themselves out, adv disguiser, someone else calling them out, etc. I could easily get screenshots of damagelogs on anyone because there are false callouts nearly every round. I have already been spoken to about the prop blocking. If you really want to get ss of everything i will wait a month and get screenshots of damage logs every round and i bet i will have just as many ss on you as you have of me. You put me down for disrespect also? I do not have proof of this because i dont just compile loads of false evidence to get someone banned when ever i want, but how many times have you called me a retard? Calling someone a whiny little bitch isn\'t as bad as a term disrespectful to mentally disabled people."},{"postId":33068,"topicId":4111,"posterId":812,"postTime":1315798120,"postText":">> Really player?

In my honest opinion a ban is needed for a repeated offense, correct?\\n\\nAnd I understand that damage in most cases is justified completely. Some of those logs are from people being KOS\'d then clearly having the KOS cancelled. There are some that I don\'t have any reason for either, sure. But you\'ve been banned twice now for RDM, is that also not enough proof that you do RDM? It\'s not a secret that you constantly make the same mistakes.\\n\\nAlso, the evidence is right there you calling 02 a whiny little bitch.\\n\\nAnd finally, yes I\'ve called you and idiot after anytime you just defend your clearly flawed logic and persistently try to prove that what you did or are thinking is right.\\n\\nWhich is another reason for this ban request. Your logic, as I said in the OP, clearly conflicts with server rules in most cases. \\n\\nIs the purpose of a punishment not supposed to have you learn that you\'re wrong and see the correct way to go about things? If not do we just allow people to repeat offenses and only think round-to-round when there\'s a ban feature? And is a ban not the only way to go when slays and slaps prove not to be enough to a player? If not, then I\'m clearly mistaken."},{"postId":33074,"topicId":4111,"posterId":672,"postTime":1315799189,"postText":"1. August 9th is over 1 month ago.\\n2. You call people retards all the time\\n3. This isnt logic at all and i didnt say that me calling him a  whiny bitch was right\\n4. There is no way to tell if these screenshots are rdm\\nThe fact that you are posting these isnt for the sake of the server, if so you would have posted them awhile ago. You posting this ban request is personal from our argument earlier today.
