For roughly 5-10 rounds he constantly picked on me and nothing happened to him. I finally just shoot him on sight ONCE and he kicks me. Later on he rdm\'s to 500 karma then nothing happens to him again, killing me 2 rounds in a row when he was innocent and leaves. Next map he comes back and i get him killed ONCE when he\'s a traitor then kicks me twice in a row. Because he thinks he is funny and cause he is a S Admin he thinks he\'s allowed to do this with no consequence. I think that me killing him once was being nice considering what he did to me for so long tonight. Furthermore on the haunted mansion lvl i was traitor once when he randomly shot/killed me. I figured taking a pic or anything is useless since he\'s a S Admin no one will do shit about it. Its k to be pissed and want to rdm once and awhile but do it with a diff name on diff server like everyone else prolly does. This is a VERY poor excuse of a admin to show the full game of what admins are allowed to do. No wonder there are a lot of kids who claim rdm or rdm a lot. And no wonder a few of the mods/admins dont do anything on a regular basis. (Names: Brando and RainRain mainly) Ive never had a problem with Gash before this. And now i dont care if pissing him off hurts his opinion on me. No one elses opinion will change and as far as im concerned, u being admin wont change wtf i do to u for pulling stupid shit like this. U do rdm and anything else u kick others for. If nothing happens to u because of ur rdm (kick/slay/ban) then i will rdm/kill u for atleast 1 round since no one has any balls to do anything. My witness for this night mainly include Cake."},{"postId":3454,"topicId":360,"posterId":6,"postTime":1277229033,"postText":"Holy shit! Sounds like i missed an interesting night!

Yeah, it means I can not use scripts.

Hard.\\nAnd it didn\'t work. I also have an aimbot, wallhack, esp, etc.. on my gmod. Yet non I can use on the server.\\n\\nAre we clear on that? Yes? okay, good.\\n\\nNow to Crisis.\\nI admit I was picking on you, mostly due to you leading to my death every single (FUCKING) time. I was raging, so I shot you a couple times. Then, once I stopped, you killed me. I was just sick of it, so I kicked you. \\nSecondly, the \\"500 karma\\" thing.\\n\\nI killed a traitor, someone shot me for it. I killed him, then someone else saw that. I ended up killing both people, so my karma went down for that. I had around 800/850 karma for a couple rounds before, so my karma took a dive. My karma was 50 over the allowed limit of 500, so I didn\'t get banned. \\n\\nThe second time I kicked you, I was a traitor. You were a detective. It was around the start of the round, and I just rejoined. I didn\'t buy anything, yet you started to scream I had a jihad bomb and got me killed. Did I have one? No. You purposely did that to get me killed, so I kicked you. I didn\'t want you arguing with me, so I didn\'t slay you.  And if you really think I only ban people if they do something to me, you\'re wrong.\\n\\nhttp://onlinecomphelp.com/bans/index.php?p=banlist\\n\\nI\'m not going to add you to that list, as you can have your opinion about me and I DID rdm you.

Thank u for not only proving my point by my post saying nothing will happen, but nothing will happen even AFTER u just admited to everything.\\n\\nOh yea, and im not afraid of being added to a banlist that i would be removed from quick. Ben\'s already agree\'d with me on this topic. Dont flaunt ur powers in front of me when u should know i dont give a shit about admin or normal player.
