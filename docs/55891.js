I find this very odd and do not agree with the freekilling punishments of JB.  4 blatant freekills is a maximum of 2 days?  Just absurd! If someone was to do that to on the server right now, I would have banned them permanently because there is no reason I would ever need that kind of player coming back; they cannot improve the JB experience in any way.  Also, you refer to a command as punishment that is currently broken, which is mute.  Ghosting is always a kick for me, never a ban because it is usually not meant maliciously, and is not normally seen again after that kick."},{"postId":30520,"topicId":3735,"posterId":101,"postTime":1314060890,"postText":"I agree with Mario.
