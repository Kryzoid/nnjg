Sumreet had not exactly been a \\"trustworthy\\" sort of guy since he often made \\"mistakes\\" of killing his own teammates. But this one time, he had gone just a little too far. He had rdmed twice (or thrice) before, counting it both as mistakes when they clearly were NOT mistakes. But when he was traitor, he blatently shot down his traitor partner, and quickly claimed that he had shot a traitor and that he was innocent. At this point, I believed he had gone too far. At that point, I had banned him for Multiple RDMs. \\n\\nNo clue why, but today he logged on, and there he was, not banned. So naturally, what did I do? Checked for an unban request. There was none. So I went ahead and re-banned him. Then he came back AGAIN. At that point I had kicked him and used Easyban to ban him from the server. So no, he did not TRY to avoid a ban. I just couldnt ban him without easyban.\\n\\nSeveral witnesses were there, and the whole server agreed that you RDM \\"by accident\\" quite a lot. The ban stays, relax a little, come back with a little less of a chip on your shoulder."},{"postId":18804,"topicId":2344,"posterId":101,"postTime":1302569068,"postText":"(Excuse this) Nobody knew if you were supposed to be banned or not really."}]}')}}]);
