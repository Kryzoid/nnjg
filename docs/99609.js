Once the prisoner is caught the cell won\'t open or close till that prisoner dies, this goes for all the cells. I\'ve only seen it maybe 4 times max. The map in question is ba_jail_mars_fix."},{"postId":36340,"topicId":4579,"posterId":1140,"postTime":1319575690,"postText":"This is not fixable from NNJG. The person who is reliable to fixing this is the map creator themselves. \\n\\nA simple solution to this problem would be adding a recovery time to the button that activates doors (Recovery time is how long it takes before it can be pressed again).\\nThis would be a simple fix, and anyone with Source SDK could do it. I could do it myself, but I wouldn\'t want to do anything to someone else\'s map without their consent."}]}')}}]);
