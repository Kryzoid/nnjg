Does this also mean that someone who sympathized with Hitler is also responsible for the millions of jews killed by the SS? Also some one claimed that the fire was coming from me. I got out of my cave looked outside and saw no fire whatsoever. Screens were also said to have been taken of me burning down the forest. Well I would like to see those screens because the interesting thing about the matter is that I was in my house the ENTIRE time this was happening. The American justice system is innocent until proven guilty. Would it make sense to charge a man with murder simply because he knew the man who was murdered?"},{"postId":14966,"topicId":1760,"posterId":153,"postTime":1296131002,"postText":">> Not sure if this would go in the regular section or Goldcraft...\\n\\nMinecraft name: humblebrick\\n\\nReason for ban: Arbitrary ban for committing a crime I did not commit.

Shows what kind of standards you have. You\'re a staff member here at NNJG and you grief on our own Minecraft server? I\'m quite amazed at the stupidity you\'ve reached and the amount of fail. You\'re a modorator on these servers and you do that, shame. And calm myself? I am calm, I\'m just saying it\'s bullshit, he doesn\'t deserve to be unbanned. He\'s a griefing troll.
