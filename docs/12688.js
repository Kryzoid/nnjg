This isn\'t that bad, but it still got me paranoid enough to want a proxy for certain things (mainly torrent finding)\\n\\nThere\'s this thing called the onion router. (tor) it pretty much kills all chance of tracing what you are doing. (assuming client side usage is correct) It works by routing your traffic through multiple different places, including user hosted servers. So when you request to see \\"Google.com\\" your request may go through many different servers until finally one decides to bring you google, and send it back. The ISPs can see that you are doing something, but no clue what. It\'s un-traceable because all bridges are burnt when sent from server to server.\\n\\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5614732/create-a-tor-button-in-chrome-for-on+demand-anonymous-browsing\\n\\nPretty quick set-up.
