The only reason im asking for this is because Gash specificly told me no more mistakes or else a ban, and i feel this is a little harsh considering i Dont break rules nor cause any disruption to the server. Not to mention i had no doing in any postings or anything behind the group. Please consider the information at hand and disreguard catogorizing me with anyone else from the group."},{"postId":28294,"topicId":3539,"posterId":54,"postTime":1312907972,"postText":"Leave the group and i\'m sure Gash will unban you."},{"postId":28296,"topicId":3539,"posterId":331,"postTime":1312908108,"postText":"i did after realizing the ban."},{"postId":28383,"topicId":3539,"posterId":2,"postTime":1312951395,"postText":"Unbanned, sorry for the wait."}]}')}}]);
