Moderator / Admin \\n\\n2) How old are you? (if you prefer to say this in private, just ask): REDACTED\\n\\n3) Where do you live? (Country, time zone): USA (Cailfornia) , EST\\n\\n4) Current In-Game Name: Balenti\\n\\n5) Steam ID & Link to your Steam Community page: STEAM_0:1:29798764 / http://steamcommunity.com/id/Balenti\\n\\n6) Email Address: REDACTED@REDACTED\\n\\n7) How long have you been involved (frequent player, moderator, donator, admin) with [NNJG] or Shadow\'s TTT/Flood/Jail/ server: I\'m a frequent player of TTT, used to be an epic warden on the JailMod server.  Don\'t know how long I\'ve been with NNJG, but I know it was the first server I played on when I downloaded my Gmod.\\n\\n8) What you can bring to the [NNJG] Team (Web/Graphic Design, Lua/other Coder, Moderation, Map Maker, ect.)?: Moderation in TTT\\n\\n9) Why do you want to be part of the [NNJG]Team?: I want to be apart of the NNJG team because I\'d love to help with the moderation in TTT or any other server you may be lacking moderation in.  You might have seen some of my Ban Requests in the forums? Some were a tad off.. I admit, but there are others that were blatant and semi-obvious. Bottom line, I want to get rid of the rdmers, freekillers, and troll groups alike.\\n\\n10 ) Any GMOD/TF2/CSS experience: TF2 experience? Yes.  CSS experience? Little to none. GMOD experience? Yes. \\n\\n11) Have you ever owned a GMOD/TF2/CSS server?: I\'m too poor to host my own server.\\n\\n12) Do you have a microphone? Do you frequently use it?: Oh why yes I do have a mic, and I daresay I use it a bit too much if you asked a regular (lulz)\\n\\n13) Any other Comments or information you can provide: I think we have quite a lot of mods/admins on the NNJG staff, but I\'d gladly join the team if the need arises ^^\\n\\nSide Note: First application in bitchz.\\n\\n Will post recommendations when obtained.  Recommendations have been completed, and I even got a kinky recommendation from Cake :3"},{"postId":16957,"topicId":2082,"posterId":2,"postTime":1299871990,"postText":">> Will post recommendations when obtained.
