It is for the classic Super Nintendo Entertainment System. What happens is your Samus Aran, a space bounty hunter chick, and your mission is to go and get the last metroid in the universe or some shit (I haven\'t played it in forever) and you fight these guys and your just like \\"This is so easy a caveman can do it\\", so you go to the room where the metroid is at, and your like \\"Well, there\'s gotta be something right?\\" Guess what happens next. All of a sudden this fucking huge purple dragon rapes you up the ass (metaphorically) and you got to kill this mofo, but he\'s pissed of and he runs the hell away and takes the metroid with it. Now the space ship that your on is about to implode (one of my favourite words) and your like \\"....Shit...\\" and you have like 3 minutes to get back to your tiny space shit. Then your ship takes you to this world where the dragon (Meta Ridley) is at and you have to get the Metroid, and then you get all these powerups and shit and you have to kill everything and it\'s awesome, and I won\'t spoil it for you. I\'m going to be posting more about other classic games, and metroid games."},{"postId":18295,"topicId":2024,"posterId":634,"postTime":1301788457,"postText":"If you haven\'t played this you are not a complete person.
