It\'s incredibly aggravating to when people ask math based questions on trivia day like 2+2 ect. If you want a math trivia day you should specify that that\'s what you want and not just say \\"trivia\\". Thanks for your time."},{"postId":37068,"topicId":4776,"posterId":101,"postTime":1320379039,"postText":"Trivia:\\"Details, considerations, or pieces of information of little importance or value.\\"\\n\\nMath would fall under the subject of \\"Pieces of information.\\"\\n\\nPlease explain on how math WOULDN\'T be trivia.

Saying \'trivia day\'\' means general trivia which includes subjects as math, science, history, world events, games, etc. Unless the LR had a specific Trivia such as \\"history trivia\\" then math could be knocked out."},{"postId":37072,"topicId":4776,"posterId":101,"postTime":1320379890,"postText":"Also, if they were to start asking very hard math problems that you don\'t know, too bad. Trivia is either you know it or you don\'t. If you don\'t know how to get the answer to the problem that\'s too bad.
