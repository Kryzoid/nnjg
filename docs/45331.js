Yes. It was not only for slapping several people with 0 damage, but also spamming the chat with you slapping yourself. \\n\\nIf you haven\'t noticed, we have had many problems with VIP\'s slap abusing. We can\'t put up with it. And to be honest, I don\'t think if you were slapping an rdmer, you would slap them with 0 damage. And the countless accounts of slaps I had witnessed, were more than enough for me to ban you for it.\\n\\nIt was not for a month, it was for a mere week. You\'re lucky it wasn\'t a month. It\'s nothing personal, we just can\'t have it."}]}')}}]);
