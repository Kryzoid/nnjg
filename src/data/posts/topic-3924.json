I took the chance that I had to play on the server for granted without really realizing the harm I was causing, this is my last unban request to nnjg before you decide if I am unbanned or not remember that I just was joking around and that I will never troll again, IF I am unbanned I assure you that this will be the last time you will see the name David Tennant before Unban request on this forum. \n\n\n I really hope  you unban me, Thank you."},{"postId":31781,"topicId":3924,"posterId":153,"postTime":1314979516,"postText":"What is your in-game-name?"},{"postId":31803,"topicId":3924,"posterId":959,"postTime":1314995305,"postText":"David Tennant"},{"postId":31821,"topicId":3924,"posterId":243,"postTime":1315004144,"postText":"Well, to be honest, I think your apology is very sincere, and I would shorten your ban from permanent to, something more subtle.\n\n\nBan shortened, locked.\n\n EDIT: (Basically, you have to wait a week) "}]}
