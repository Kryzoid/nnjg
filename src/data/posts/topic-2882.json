I finally got a word in and said \"If you talk on mic while I'm giving orders you will be shot. Wait till I'm done.\" I could tell it was loud and clear because everyone stopped talking. Then Human Aimbot is in his cell and is testing me by saying \"Haha... Hi guard.\" so I shot him. Then I gave orders to go to back wall... a few didn't listen, so I shot them.
