I have banned people before for this, and I don't see why I should unban  you , you has been banned before, instead of the other people.\n\nYou have mass-rdmed, revenge rdmed, trolled, and ragequit-rdmed. I don't know if we should even bother the unban. I don't really see a point in it after all this. Does Ben or Bird have anything to say?\n\n :-\\"},{"postId":4087,"topicId":438,"posterId":153,"postTime":1278857558,"postText":"Don't blame punk.
