I'm applying for moderator in jailbreak. I've been there for a fairly long time but i've not been active in the past week due to computer crashes.\n3. Well, I run a Jailbreak server for CS:S, and a darkRP server for garrysmod. I moderate on garrysmod using ULX, what NNJG uses. And on cs:s I use sourcemod."},{"postId":17537,"topicId":2115,"posterId":3,"postTime":1300577936,"postText":"Do you perhaps have a sample photo of a map you've made?
