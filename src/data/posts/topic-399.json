He bans people for rdming him only. He also revenge kills. He said he would slay people 3 times in a row for rtving during round because he was traitor. He was good at first. But now he's just fucking power hungry. He muted me for \"spamming\" Yet the whole server was spamming. And he wont unmute people. He'll keep them muted till they leave. And I tried avoiding mute due to the fact, he wont unmute people. He muted The Misfit once for \"He was GOING to troll\" but he didn't even know that. _Crisis didn't even have to apply or anything, now it's all going to his head.....\n\nIM QUITTING FUCK NNJG SERVERS"},{"postId":3793,"topicId":399,"posterId":79,"postTime":1277695565,"postText":"I didn't say anything of the sort, and many people were here today when i banned u for 60 minutes.

Therefore I left. This isn't about my ban, it's about your mod abusing. You're a fail mod, you revenge kill, and you mute people when they do nothing wrong."},{"postId":3797,"topicId":399,"posterId":79,"postTime":1277696380,"postText":"I unmute if people dont bitch constantly like little trolling kids, when u complain non-stop y would i unmute u just to complain over mic chat.
