So I'm gonna go ahead and address it. Trolling is not accepted, and can result in a ban. So, I'm going to ask the current staff members to START handing out warnings then bans of people who are constantly trolling. Crisis (as he says) is a target for everyone to troll, so if they keep it up, they're going to get banned. I'm going to ask Crisis to start taking screenshots and demos of people trolling him, and if it's evidence, I or one of the staff members will hand out a ban. \n\nk. thanks. bai."}]}
