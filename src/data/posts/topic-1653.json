I'm not having fun on the servers and I want to take a little break so I can come back later and have fun instead of hating to have to play. I am probally going to still play a bit, some people have probally noticed I haven't been very active.\nThe two main things I am going to try to get away from for a little bit are:\n1 Stupid people. Enough said. You broke a rule, so don't complain about the punishment. Gtfo.\n2 People calling on me to drop what I'm doing to join them: This isn't really a problem, but it annoys the shit out of me when they call me in the server and say \"Oh an admins in now, you're gunna get banned.\"\n\nSo yeah I'm going to take a break from the servers and play some others >.>\nI'll be back soon. Bye. Hopefully when I come back I can actually have fun playing the servers again..."},{"postId":14336,"topicId":1653,"posterId":54,"postTime":1295210432,"postText":"Taking a break to that D3vine shit server?
