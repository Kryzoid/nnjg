But this here is a clear example against it. \n\nI think mods should have the ability to ban, so they are seperated from vips and can actually do something. but I just think we need to think more about who we add for positions of power.\nHell, I'd never even seen Swaim play before he got mod. But he did cry like a fucking baby anytime he was told no.\n\nI blame Boomshaka though considering he originally suggested swaim.
