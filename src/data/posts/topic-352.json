Pretty much he has been shortchanged ammo for all of his bought guns, for example he has only recieved 2 rockets, 45 SMG ammo and a couple Crossbow shots. He is a solid player and he is on flood a lot so I would hate to see him have to leave the server because of a glitch like this,"},{"postId":3348,"topicId":352,"posterId":48,"postTime":1277139648,"postText":"I'm pretty sure he already informed Bird of this, and he is working on it."},{"postId":3373,"topicId":352,"posterId":3,"postTime":1277148934,"postText":"Working on it, strange glitch."},{"postId":3414,"topicId":352,"posterId":153,"postTime":1277174024,"postText":">> Bob Dole\":h2mz0vhr]\nWorking on it, strange glitch.\n \ntell Non-Toxic about it."},{"postId":3450,"topicId":352,"posterId":3,"postTime":1277228374,"postText":">> Ben\":3hnwdl4j]\n>> Bob Dole\":3hnwdl4j]\nWorking on it, strange glitch.\n \ntell Non-Toxic about it.\n \nI know >.< He gets it too"}]}
