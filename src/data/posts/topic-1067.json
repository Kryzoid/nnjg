The screenshot Punk got for me on my birthday of a few of you crowbarring Happy Birthday Cake onto the wall at Peaches has been the background on my desktop ever since I got it. Although I might try that for him, idk if it will be as special to him as it was to me because he doesn't play here, so I would like something else. \n   If anyone out of the goodness of their heart and to help make someones birthday better, make a cool background for him. Personality and interest wise he is the polar opposite of me. Were I am nice lovable anime obsessive with the taste for Alt, Grunge, and a little bit of J-Rock, he only accepts metal, he talks in caps, and if it isn't brutal, sexy or f@%*ing awesome, he doesn't want it. He loves Metallica, Dethklok, The Misfits, Rob Zombie, pretty much anything heavy metal, and hot chicks (and of course I want it to say Happy Birthday or Happy Birthday Misfit on it).
