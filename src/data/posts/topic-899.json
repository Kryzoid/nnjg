For EVERY. BATTLE. Normal mode (Higher hp, Weaker hits, Shows bosses HP) Hard (Much much higher damage, normal hp, Doesn't show bosses hp) And Hero (Living hell, Unbelievably hard, Only for levels 25+)\n\nAnd Then the godly raids. oh the FUCKING GODLY RAIDS. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnqrspmncbQ\n\nnot much more to be said about that epicness.\n\nVindictus's PVP isn't really the shining spot (Atleast from what i have seen, since its not even released yet) But its still pretty damn fun."},{"postId":8663,"topicId":899,"posterId":48,"postTime":1286042907,"postText":"First of all, one boss in a cave is hardly a raid.\n\nSecondly, all that video did was proved my point that all they were doing was beating the shit out of it for 7 minutes, \nand I saw no special strategies or anything that had to be done.\n\nAnd no special effects, simply clicking to kill?\nSo you just hit it with your sword 1000 times, and you don't actually have to use specific moves to increase damage output, just spam the same shit over and over?

Because that sounds boring as fuck to me. \n\n\nThe boss is the final part of the battle, in raids theres a hugeass part before it (Too long for videos, i mean MY current battles are around 20 minutes, and im level 15!) including alot of minibosses,\n\nSpecial strategies: Stunning a boss is key to killing it, which is done by using smash skills (Strong kills done at the end of a combo) But normally a boss won't give you time to do so, So you can also throw extremely heavy (Normally pillar peices) objects at it to help, But the bigger the boss, The more it takes to stun.\n\nIn vindictus, you can't even CLICK, Unless you use the mouse set up, which still keeps you active nonstop, As you have to click to slash, While in wow, a simple click will engage a battle, and normally you can just sit back and watch.\n\nWhile the specific moves might not seem so, A smash attack is done at the end of a normal combo and gives an extreme amount of damage, And even more special skills for doing so.\n\n>spam the same shit over and over\n\nCAUSE YOU TOTALLY DON'T DO THAT IN WOW RITE\n\nAlso:\n\nLanns moves: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U_QXS76UiA\n\n\nEDIT: In vindictus there are a few characters you choose off to start from, They are genderlocked and have specific skill sets, I couldn't agree with you more about how i dislike it, But it isn't as balanced if you see a mage with twin swords summoning a golem and stabbing you 30 times before a smash attack, is it? And animations aren't easy to make here either\n\n\nAND ANOTHER RAID:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8AsYU5wDr0\n\n\nFYI: The first raid is the first raid in the game overall, the polar bear one."},{"postId":8666,"topicId":899,"posterId":48,"postTime":1286047365,"postText":"Sit back and watch?\nYeah, okay.\n\nIf you just autoattack a boss, you aren't going to get very far.\nMost bosses have enrage timers, so if you don't down them quick enough, it's an automatic wipe.\n\nAnd okay, if theres alot of trash before bosses which takes a little while, that's fine and all, but that sounds just like a normal dungeon, not really a raid. Most raids consist of like 10+ bosses with trash in between each one, and take numerous hours to do - often they have to be continued on a second, or even third date to be completed, and what I'm doing right now (Icecrown citadel), our guild has ran it like 20 times, and we still can only down 11 of the 12 bosses, because it takes that much gearing up to be able to do.\n\nAnd i have no idea what you mean about mages with swords and golems and shit.\nAll classes are fairly balanced in WoW,  there are multiple talent trees you can spec into to (mages can be pryo, frost, or arcane),\nso almost everyone has slightly differerent shit. Also there are things you have to gain from gear; for example endgame, a tank has to get 540 defense rating across all his pieces of gear to be able to fight bosses w/o getting wtfpwned.\n\nJust from what I've seen of Vindictus, it just seems like one of those games where you just go around killing shit, without any sort of strategies or anything.\n\nDo you even need a tank and a healer in that game?

But not for anything else naturally.\n\n\nIn vindictus, you can't EVEN autoattack, Keeping you active and motivated nearly all the time, Contributing to more fun :D\n\nRaids are different in every game, Raids in vindictus are unusually large parties grouped up together to take down a son of a bitch hard boss.\n\nStrategy? Strategy is nearly everything after half of the first boat, Becuase its pretty easy to just hack and slash for the first part, Then when it gets to extremely tough missions (Wind through the ruins) Where bosses INSTAKILL you on NORMAL mode, you'r going to need to strategize alot more. You'll also need strategy to find out what to do to get the extra battle points for a mission.\n\n\nALSO, COMPARE:\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoYoTxJzmB0\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnKJpXZxmyU\n\n\nALSO: please notice i have not really participated in a raid (im too low level for the red tyrant raid) so im just saying shit out of assumption.\n\n\nALSOOOOOOOO\n\nORGAAAAAAAAASMICCCC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efhfoZQEZ6c&feature=player_embedded"},{"postId":8673,"topicId":899,"posterId":48,"postTime":1286059251,"postText":">> Tanks and Mages aren't key to vindictus, Specially since its a really cheap form of gameplay (One person takes all the damage and 2 others can simply summon a golem, Collect items for it to absorb, And then watch the golem obliterate the boss, Cheap rite) Mages are somewhat important, But you won't be relying on evie's skill to heal really, Your more focused on trying to NOT GET ATTACKED, Because no, Attacking isn't an instahit (unlike wow which has a stat to determine % of missing), You actually have to MOVE OUT OF THE DAMN WAY, unless you really want to fucking die.\n\nBosses have a more complex system (Unlike most games where it goes after the person who did most damage), Which i still don't understand properly, But it trys to attack everyone with its hugeass attack range (Basically if theres 2 people standing still to the right of it, and 1 person attacking it with alot of might, It tries to attack the most people to inflict more damage, So it goes for the 2 bystanders), OH AND DID YOU NOTICE BOSSES ACTUALLY MOVE.\n\nAnd sure if you autoattack a BOSS your going to fucking die.

Realistic. The slightest move may or may not save you, You always have to be on the look out for traps then come up of a way to evade them *Throw a object in them duh*\n\nIm taking all my info about WoW from what you provide me, And since you don't really seem to be showing why WoW is so epic, Mainly \"no its just better\", Sure your somewhat argueing against why its not horrible (I personally don't think its HORRIBLE, But i just simply don't like it.)\n\nI honestly can't understand all these fucking wow fanboys (No offence bro), Its like they think wow is a god-tier game and nothing else will beat it, When in simple fact many games have, In multiple sections, Graphics wise, Combat wise, PvE Wise, PvP wise and etc."}]}
