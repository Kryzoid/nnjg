But after two people reccomended me i felt a bit more confident, so i posted this just to give it a try, i can be a fun mod, and i can be a super strict mod, But more to the fun side :D, If i do make it, I'll Always give a warn first, Then Proceed to more punishments,Unless of course it was sever and on on purpose. I already got the TTT Server to go in shape since i proclaimed i would save a log of every case of rule breaking and report it, But i can't (Or can i?) since i didnt provide a screeny, only a event log.\n\n\n\nADMIN ACCEPTIONS ^^ == Yes /== Maybe X== No\nGash [^^]\nBen [^^]\nBob Dole [^^]\n\n\n\nRecco's:\n\n\n1.
