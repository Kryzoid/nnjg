If you have a dead 8800 that lasted a few years, and then suddenly started having problems and soon died, then you are one of trillions of people!  You can BAKE your video card!  Look it up on Youtube, I will try it soon, and I should have my very expensive piece of hardware up and running again! (Although I already replaced it with a 9800, the 8800 is still fairly new and should sell easily.)"},{"postId":31158,"topicId":3834,"posterId":735,"postTime":1314559882,"postText":"Is this about blackberries?"},{"postId":31186,"topicId":3834,"posterId":252,"postTime":1314564971,"postText":"8800 Ultra?
