It may has changed alot, and many people have come and go. But I still like it alot. I used to be an administrator here (duh) and I have been told that I was a good one, at that. \n\n 7) How did you find out about NNJG:   I first found out about NNJG by my brother WackyAl/Snivy. He was trying out TTT for the first time, and asked me to try out the server he was on. The first server he joined was ours. Ever since then I have been playing. I have only played other TTT servers... once or twice this whole time I've been here. \n\n 8) How long have you been involved with NNJG and/or Shadow's servers:   I first played the servers about 3 days before registering on the forums, (never made an intro) And I joined the forums on Tue Aug 31, 2010. \n\n 9) How long have you been a registered user on Steam:   I have been a registered steam user since May 19, 2009 \n\n 10) What you can bring to the NNJG Team:   I can bring good moderation, and lots of good timez! \n\n 11) Why do you want to be part of the NNJG Team:   I want to be part of the team again, because I didn't realize what I had left. The first few days I had actually been trying to use my admin binds, and things like that. I began to think \"Oh, I dont have to worry about anything anymore.\" but I couldn't do it. I would try to play, be selfish almost. I couldnt really do it, and when I tried to help, I realized that lots of people aren't nice. I want to be with staff again because I miss it, and I enjoy administrating out wonderful server. \n\n 12) Do you have any past experience with the position you're applying for:   Well, I was admin on this one server once.. I think It was called NNJG.. \n\n 13) Have you ever posted a ban request, and if so, was it accepted:   Yes. \n\n 14) How often do you play on an NNJG server:   I try to play at least once a day, average an hour, but I have school so I am very active on the weekends, and less active on the weekdays. \n\n 15) Do you own a decent microphone, and do you frequently utilize it:   Nope \n\n 16) How fast/well can you type:   Pretty fast, I am very picky about typing well, also. \n\n 17) What is your favorite and least favorite aspect of NNJG:    Favorite:   The community, its very nice, everyone knows each other, and the administrators treat people fairly. \n  Least favorite:    I do become very annoyed at the excessive amount of people who  don't  read the MOTD, but we cant really do anything about that. \n\n 18) Any other comments or information you can provide:   I wub you guyz, I really want to ban trollz and stuff. ............ <3  \n\n\n\n\nI messed up when I quit, and I regret it.
