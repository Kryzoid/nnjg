I have a good understanding of the rules and enforcing the rules, I also try explaining the rules to fellow newbie players who are unfamiliar with the jailbreak concept and its rules to help expand the player base. I generally play in the evenings to late night whenever the server is up and on the weekends.\n\n7) How did you find out about NNJG: Found out one day browsing through the multiple servers, was the first server I played as well.\n\n8) How long have you been involved with NNJG and/or Shadow's servers: late July, but official sign up on forums was on Aug 14th.\n\n9) How long have you been a registered user on Steam: Late July\n\n10) What you can bring to the NNJG Team: Moderation and assistance to newbie players so they feel comfortable with the server, or become a better guard.\n\n11) Why do you want to be part of the NNJG Team: I would like to help the NNJG team by moderating the server when other mods aren't on such as evenings or late nights or whenever a moderator isn't around to deal with a troll or somebody truly ruining the game for everybody.\n\n12) Do you have any past experience with the position you're applying for: Yes, VIP work on the server, I generally use this to help or stall the problem till a mod can arrive to deal with them.\n\n13) Have you ever posted a ban request, and if so, was it accepted: Yes, several times with all of them approved with proper evidence and explanation to the person of why they are being reported.\n\n14) How often do you play on an NNJG server: Evenings to late nights along with the weekends.\n\n15) Do you own a decent microphone, and do you frequently utilize it: Yes I have a good mic and use it all the time when communicating with my team or prisoners.  \n\n16) How fast/well can you type: When somebody tries RDMing on the server when we're lined up I can generally slap sense into them before the third person is killed\n\n17) What is your favorite and least favorite aspect of NNJG: Honestly I dont know what to say what my least favorite aspect is, if anything its vanishing mods, my favorite it the friendliness of the staff, you're all cool and you helped me a lot when learning about JB\n\n18) Any other comments or information you can provide: I'd really like to help out the JB staff, whenever I come onto the server with no mods or VIP the players usually tell me quick about who is RDMing and I have a word with them telling them they will be reported and possibly banned if they keep it up. I spend a lot of time on this server, in fact all the hours logged into garrys mod are from the JB server.\n\nPicture evidence of people approving:\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app1.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app2.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app3.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app4.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app5.jpg  <- contains three approvals\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app6.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app7.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app8.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app9.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app10.jpg\nhttp://i756.photobucket.com/albums/xx201/maikeru_03/app11.jpg\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/stratos83/screenshot/541782282460376790?tab=public\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/stratos83/screenshot/541782282459892158?tab=public"},{"postId":35629,"topicId":4527,"posterId":101,"postTime":1318904941,"postText":"Your application has been automatically denied due to the fact you have not reached a post count of 30 yet on the forums.
