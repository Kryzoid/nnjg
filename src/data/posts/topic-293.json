In short, the server and people on the server kick ass. \n\n8 ) I have been playing GMOD for over a year and a half now so I know a lot about building etc.\n\n9) I have never owned a GMOD server though I did look into it at one time.\n\n10) I have donated in the past and will continue to donate as long as I am playing GMOD. I will not abuse my powers as admin, but I will not be afraid to use them against people who try to break rules.\n\n http://s781.photobucket.com/albums/yy92/Weezer20911/?action-view¤t=recommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmms.jpg \n\n http://s781.photobucket.com/albums/yy92/Weezer20911/?action-view¤t=recoms1.jpg \n\n http://s781.photobucket.com/albums/yy92/Weezer20911/?action-view¤t=Recommmmms.jpg \n\n http://s781.photobucket.com/albums/yy92/Weezer20911/?action-view¤t=recom.jpg \n\n http://s781.photobucket.com/albums/yy92/Weezer20911/?action-view¤t=recom.jpg#!oZZ4QQcurrentZZhttp%3A%2F%2Fs781.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fyy92%2FWeezer20911%2F%3Faction-view%26current%3Dreccomsss.jpg%26 \n\nThanks for reviewing my application and thanks to all who recommended me."},{"postId":2791,"topicId":293,"posterId":58,"postTime":1276457704,"postText":"For some reason my links for the pics didnt work so ill jsut my post my photobucket account which is where they are shown. \n\n\nhttp://s781.photobucket.com/home/Weezer20911/index\n\nSorry about that"},{"postId":2802,"topicId":293,"posterId":12,"postTime":1276467689,"postText":"hmm you have the reccos but its not up too me.
