Occasionally there is a glitch that seems to happen most often on Onesmallshamble (though it can happen on other maps) where it says that you're the only Traitor, even though their are others. (\"You stand alone.\", nobody but you appears in red on the scoreboard, T's don't appear above your actual buddies heads) This can happen to (maybe?) everyone and has about (I'm guessing) a 1 in 100 chance when you are traitor to happen. If this happens to you, just ask in Traitor chat who your buddies are. It's a mistake and that's why he isn't being punished."}]}
