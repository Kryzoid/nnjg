I do not know why this happens, I just know that after the server host was switched, it has started to happen on maps that previously it did not. This \"bug\" could keep us from adding new maps, and is probably one of the most obvious on the Jailbreak server."},{"postId":31596,"topicId":3639,"posterId":956,"postTime":1314832046,"postText":"We should do something so we can keep adding maps i dont want to be playing the same old same old"},{"postId":31698,"topicId":3639,"posterId":153,"postTime":1314913845,"postText":"Do you know which maps crash it?"},{"postId":36342,"topicId":3639,"posterId":1140,"postTime":1319575874,"postText":"I seemed to have gotten this problem a while back, but it no longer occurs to me.
