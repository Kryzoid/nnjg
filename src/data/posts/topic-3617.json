But we don't get VIP in server?\n\nWell I got an idea, that will help NNJG out, and be a good reason to let us be VIP on the forums/servers.\n\nTo be a VIP it will cost 10$ a month, but that 10$ will get you VIP on all NNJG servers. Don't forget you aren't losing anything because it is a monthly Fee. After 1 month, if they don't donate again they get removed from VIP, until they pay the next month. its just an idea I had and i was wondering if that could work out, or if it has been done before."},{"postId":29245,"topicId":3617,"posterId":812,"postTime":1313356453,"postText":"I seriously disagree with a monthly VIP fee.

It's not like donations are never coming in. If that was the case, then a monthly VIP fee might have to be implemented to keep it running.\n\nAlso we have 50+ VIP's. 50 x 5 is $250 a month, $3,000 a year. TOTALLY not what it is worth to keep all the current servers up."},{"postId":29253,"topicId":3617,"posterId":634,"postTime":1313358328,"postText":"Most people are not attracted to the idea of monthly unless you give them major benefits, and NNJG is not about letting people buy powers so naturally that wouldn't work.\nBut people do donate often. There a quite a few members that have donated more often then the first ten dollars, and in times of low VIP purchases, that can keep the server going.\nThe main problem we have now with creating new VIP benefits is the time and skills necessary to create new in game benefits with lua."},{"postId":29255,"topicId":3617,"posterId":760,"postTime":1313358778,"postText":"I can make more servers if people will play them.
