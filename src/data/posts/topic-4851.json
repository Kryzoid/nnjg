Seriously? I got banned for being in a group everyone forgot about but thats okay with me but Banning Sohi? wtf? Seriously if noone sees anything wrong with this then there's something wrong with you. Gash, quit shitting all over this server. Sohi can make any server awesome yet Gash decides to perm ban him....Why? Because i invited him to a group that tells the truth? And has almost nothing to do with Gash or NNJG.Unban Sohi."},{"postId":37558,"topicId":4851,"posterId":2,"postTime":1320819538,"postText":"He was banned for joining a \"hate group.\" Leaving the group along with notifying Ben or I will result in an unban."},{"postId":37570,"topicId":4851,"posterId":812,"postTime":1320868482,"postText":"Sorry for making this post, I know I shouldn't.\n\nBut Danny, you're saying YOU invited Sohi to the group KNOWING the consequences of admittance into the group, then when he JOINS you make a thread about it....I hope you see the fallacy."}]}
