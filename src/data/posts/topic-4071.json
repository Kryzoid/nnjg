Explosive barrles was Driftwood, Random shooting however was purely a reflex i saw Udane come around the corner with a knife and i think i clipped his shoulder but then i rememberd he was proven, RDM Was self defense, i cant quite remember his tag but it was like Fox Mccloud or something he started to hit me with his crowbar so i shot him, but he never said crowbar fight! random shooting was me and udane shooting some glass. I think i posted a previous request but i was tired so things were a bit shakey. This should be more accurate than my previous so thanks for youre time."},{"postId":32808,"topicId":4071,"posterId":812,"postTime":1315627762,"postText":"Dude, you just made this like two days ago.
