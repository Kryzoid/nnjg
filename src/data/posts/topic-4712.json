I lol'd.\n\nAnyway, this is denied. Why? YOU gave me two warnings to leave the area (not to mention, you can't do that. Area claiming isn't allowed). So, I began to leave, then your friend Nova decides to kill me AND wetpads for no reason. You said out loud \"haha, Nova good job Nova. You got the traitor\" and said something about the traitor killing me. I checked the logs, and he killed both of us. Then, you and Nova went crying to Udane saying you gave 3 warnings, which you didn't. Then gave another story to me. You both are obviously lying, and will not be unbanned. \n\n  Denied.  "}]}
