I was just saying i will miss everyone in a jokingly manor. Gash you take everything i do the wrong way. It wasn't meant to mean, \"Hey everyone i got banned for no reason\".

Can you please unlock my other Post?"},{"postId":37561,"topicId":4853,"posterId":634,"postTime":1320842528,"postText":"You could just post it in the spam box if you wanted a place to talk to people through the forums. When you put it in other sections it just looks like your trying to get Wabbajack."},{"postId":37574,"topicId":4853,"posterId":612,"postTime":1320870026,"postText":"Which is stupid by the way. No one really cares about post count. I think that the spam box should be done away with. If all you ever spout is mountains of stupid shit. Then don't talk ever.

I think gash thought you were trying to make a point. But you weren't intending to."},{"postId":37607,"topicId":4853,"posterId":706,"postTime":1320919844,"postText":"Oh i didn't even think about the spam box.
