If so, it must be the doors. If you are standing right next to them when the guards open them, it's a strange glitch that kills you.

It occurs as soon as the next round begins.  Sometimes for me it would say I suicided in the console.  I'm guessing it couldn't find a place for me on the map so it killed me.  I'm not sure but it defiantly is not only for him.
