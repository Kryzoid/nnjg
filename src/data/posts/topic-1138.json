Please tell me your feedback!  \n\n  \n\n VAPORIZER: \n•Ammo: 1.\n•Drains health to 0 for 5 seconds, if the victim is at full health.  (Victim has 100 health = 5 seconds to kill)\n•Works best far away, where the victim cant fight back.\n•Has a straight line from the victim to the traitor, until the victim dies.\n•The straight line is visible to everybody and easily tracks the traitor down, which is why it works best away from people.\n•Has no DNA evidence.\n•The model is a Rifle.\n•The sound is not very loud.\n•Innocents usually rely on the line to track down the killer.\n\n Mines: \n•Ammo: 2.\n•Blows up when anyone steps near it.\n•Hurts 50, and people go flying like they got hit by a discombobulator.\n•Little DNA evidence.  (Decays fast)\n•Death by explosion or falling.\n•The traitor laughs when the mine blows up.\n•Explodes when shot by a bullet.\n•Has remains of pieces of metal lying around, which have evidence on them.\n•Model: Tool Gun, placed like C4 onto walls, floor, or ceiling.\n\n Crossbow: \n•Ammo: 1.\n•Evidence like a knife.\n•No mellee attack.\n•Longer ranged than a knife throw.\n•100 damage.\n•Model: Crossbow.\n•Easy to track down with DNA scanner."}]}
