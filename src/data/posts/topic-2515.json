When playing on the PS3 I never was like \"OH SHIT THESE GRAPHICS KICK MY XBOX'S ASSSSSS\" and was never like \"THIS CONTROLLER OFFERS SO MUCH MORE MOVEMENT AND CONTROLLLLLLL\" It was just like playing any other game unless that game was on the Wii, which blows. The motion control on the PS3 controller wasn't very good, you pretty much just had to seizure it to do anything correctly. Whenever I played MGS online, I had major problems just finding a game. It would take almost 20 minutes to find the game, and then you hafd to connect. That's just me though, or maybe not. On Xbox, I can join games almost instantly, and I have the older version of the xbox. And almost every good game that's coming out on PS3, also has a PC or Xbox version also, even Metal Gear Solid Rising is coming out on Xbox. I think that the Xbox is just a better buy in my opinion, but over all the PC dominates both."},{"postId":20872,"topicId":2515,"posterId":252,"postTime":1304598686,"postText":">> can we atleast rule out all console and agree that PC over all gaming \n>> I think that the Xbox is just a better buy in my opinion, but over all the PC dominates both. \nThank you!"},{"postId":20919,"topicId":2515,"posterId":595,"postTime":1304647586,"postText":">> >> can we atleast rule out all console and agree that PC over all gaming \n>> I think that the Xbox is just a better buy in my opinion, but over all the PC dominates both. \nThank you! \n\nMAC IS THE BEST!"},{"postId":20920,"topicId":2515,"posterId":48,"postTime":1304648030,"postText":">> >> >> can we atleast rule out all console and agree that PC over all gaming \n>> I think that the Xbox is just a better buy in my opinion, but over all the PC dominates both. \nThank you! \n\nMAC IS THE BEST! \n\nif you like penis in your ass."},{"postId":20923,"topicId":2515,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304648259,"postText":"I declare vista the best"},{"postId":20934,"topicId":2515,"posterId":373,"postTime":1304652997,"postText":">> I declare vista the best \n\nGet out.
