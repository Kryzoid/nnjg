Most of those I'm not sure whether to ban them or not, so I just leave them for someone else to do it. Of course, they get banned. I say that we have to make it so you have to have multiple damage logs just to even get it considered as long as it isn't \"___ killed 5 innocents in 1 round\", as we'd obviously accept that.\n\nExample:  http://nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=122&t=4024 "},{"postId":32868,"topicId":4075,"posterId":115,"postTime":1315687357,"postText":"I think we should just have guidelines for US to decide whats ban worthy and whats not."},{"postId":32869,"topicId":4075,"posterId":101,"postTime":1315687563,"postText":"Also a good alternative."},{"postId":32900,"topicId":4075,"posterId":252,"postTime":1315696797,"postText":"Can we require the postround scores too?
