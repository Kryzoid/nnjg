Well, time for me to go. Personally I think shits been going down the drain, even though I'm probably wrong. And the amount of little kids coming on and not being muted has gone too far.\n\nSo, I've chosen to leave. And its not because I'm banned, I've actually been wanting to do this for awhile. I'll come back once kids under 14 get permagagged and some things finally get to go right.\n\nEvery other person who's left has a list of cool and bad people, so I'll give mine.\n\nCool:\nFunnyraff - I'LL MISS YOU SO MUCH ;_;\nOdd One - Maybe one day we can break the spike pit again in lost temple.\nKryzoid - luv you\nq - didn't see you much never really talked to you much, but you seemed cool\nMr. Gash - Keep it up..\nSmooglez - Shin Chan with a Afro\nBewmshaka - NOU\nChopper - LOLGIRLMODEL\nCake/Pedobear - We'll have to molest Gash's daughter again sometime.\nNot cool:\nEvery little kid on the server, burn in hell.\nTraitor - Won't miss you.\nPharaoh - Never did like you either.\nMark/Evil Monkey - Tightass.\nLuigi - Cool at first, now I just don't like you.\n_Crisis - My face every time I saw you get on: :|\nBalenti - Same as above.\nUpside down name guy or something - I never liked you.\n\nI can't be halfed ass to make a full long post, I got a virus and I'm posting this in steam web browser. I'll assume no one will miss me.  So, I'll paste a song I gave to funny.\n\n\"Well here we are, it's always such a pleasure. Remember when you tried to mute me twice? Oh how we laughed and laughed, except I wasn't laughing. Under these circumstances, I'm being shockingly nice.\n\nYou want your little kids? Take them. Thats what I've come to expect.\n\nI used to want them banned, but now I only want to leave.\n\nThere alot like you(maybe not as smart)\n\nNow those kids are in there for good.\n\nOne day I joined in, so I could play forever. Its such a shame it won't get to happen!\n\nYou got your short sad servers left, thats what I've come to expect.\n\nI'll let you get right to them, now I only want to leave.\n\nGoodbye my only friends, OH. Did you think I meant you guys? That would be funny, if it weren't so sad. Well, you have been replaced. I don't need you anymore. When I leave the group maybe I'll [redacted]\n\nLet more little kids in, that's what I've come to expect.\n\nYour just letting in more problems, now I only want to leave.\n\nNow I only want to leave.\n\nNow I only want to \n\nleave.\"\n\nBtw, no one will miss me.
