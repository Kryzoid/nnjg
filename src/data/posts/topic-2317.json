Put your name below and either provide a link to a picture, a picture, or something saying what you want (Example: I want a mudkip.) (I put that example because I JUST FREAKING PUT ON A MUDKIP TRAIL. HELL YES)\n\nIn order to enter:\n-No requirements, just post below. ONE entry per a person\n\nRules:\n-No pornography\n-Nothing offensive\n-No clan or group advertisements \n-Nothing user-specific if it's a trail allowed for everyone (As in just text with a name. Avatars are OK.)\n\nDeadline to post: April 12th\n\nWinner will be randomly chosen using random.org.\n\nWinner...:\n\n-Receives the trail they picked for free (or at least 1 point)\n-Gets to negotiate a price for the trail (No I won't put a trail of your avatar on there for 50000 points, just knowing you get it for free)\n-If we find/think of a way, winner gets his trail exclusively."},{"postId":18617,"topicId":2317,"posterId":4,"postTime":1302238533,"postText":"http://www.geekologie.com/2010/09/03/double-rainbow-for-windows.jpg\n(I don't want anything custom, just a rainbow trail if possible ;_;)"},{"postId":18618,"topicId":2317,"posterId":2,"postTime":1302240182,"postText":"It's actually rather easy to make a trail only available for one person."},{"postId":18621,"topicId":2317,"posterId":243,"postTime":1302268417,"postText":"Its so bright, and vivid.\n http://www.futurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/blue_light_1.jpg "},{"postId":18629,"topicId":2317,"posterId":101,"postTime":1302295092,"postText":"Update: Transparency will work well if you don't want you trail looking semi-odd.
