Because guards like Mike Hawk, and another named Soccer7 (however, I do not have evidence to report him), couldn't help themselves from killing disguised prisoners, I'm back to report another offender. Mike Hawk's only reply to me telling him I will report him, is him not believing me. He didn't deny freekill in any way or form.\n\nOffender name?: Mike Hawk - Attorney at Law\nWhich Server?: \nOffender's Steam ID?: STEAM_0:1:26693292\nWhat the Offender did?: Freekilled a disguised prisoner, not the first time, and just being a general douche I think.\nAdmins on?: Nope.\nProof?:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN3JsqZxFew\nAnd yes, I am aware that I sound pretty gay in this video... But that escapes the point. You can clearly see I was disguised when my body hits the floor, and you can also hear his only argument, that he doesn't actually believe that I was recording the round. He clearly doesn't care about what he did."},{"postId":13899,"topicId":1593,"posterId":101,"postTime":1294466249,"postText":"Isn't that HumbleBrick?
