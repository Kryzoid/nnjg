I think T's seeing it like C4 would prevent maybe 20% of the mishaps the other 80% would be on the person that set it off. If you don't see a icon when you are walking into it, then god help you. (Prolly shouldn't play TTT because 90% chance you'll kill an ally since you cant see the T above the head)"}]}
