(http://teamfortress2.fr/achievements.php?eng)\n\nHOWEVER, do YOU want to actually EARN your achievements rather than just CREATE them?! NOWS YOUR TIME! I start by setting an achievement, and whoever accomplishes it first gets to earn that achievement forever! (Put it in your sig, whatnot)\n\nNow we have a perfect thing for this (remember, please keep all your current ones) (Yeah, Im bored, I want to liven this place up a bit...)\n\nAlso, the first person to accomplish the last objective gets to set a NEW one in place, for others to accomplish! (Please be reasonable.)\n\nAlso as an update:\n-From the now unofficial rules of Achievements in your signatures, you may only have 2 custom ones, and must not relate to any of the contests :D\n-In achievements, refer to yourself as \"The Host\".
