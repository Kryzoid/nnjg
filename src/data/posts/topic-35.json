If I get comp lag or any lag at all and I'm typing a message, and KEEP typing, it used to show up after a second or 2. Now it stops responding because of the ghey way they did it.\n\nAlso, when I start my computer, right clicking on the icon doesn't always works. And the shift+tab thing lags gmod, it has a lot of pointless things. I don't care what I earned on gmod, woo-hoo. It's not like I'm going to get an award for it. So I don't need to see it. And if you sign out of chat, and put your computer into sleep mode, you can't sign back in. You have to restart your computer. I may as well turn it off if it does that."},{"postId":1738,"topicId":35,"posterId":55,"postTime":1275164575,"postText":"oh ok"},{"postId":1776,"topicId":35,"posterId":48,"postTime":1275188692,"postText":"I liked the old steam better.
