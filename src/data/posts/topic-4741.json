Including this, and every other \"Your Favorite Martian\" song.â€‰\n\nTo make it more constructive, RWJ gets a shitload of money and credit for just going \"HAY LUK AT WUT THESE GUYES DID\"\n\nYFM's songs are all completely repetitive. Every single one of them sounds the same, with just a repeating chorus. (ex. \"Stalk stalk stalk stalking your mom x50;We're all living in an 8 bit world, 8 bit world, 8 bit world x50) The songs have absolutely no variation, and it must be really easy to write his songs. Find a funny phrase, then just slam random rapped verses into it that try and make him sound somewhat nostalgic (but doesn't execute it well at all) and then repeat the \"funny'' phrase about 50 times over for the chorus."},{"postId":36995,"topicId":4741,"posterId":1099,"postTime":1320284470,"postText":"well..
