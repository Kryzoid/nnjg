If they're spamming chat, gag them. If they rejoin to avoid it, simple permanently mute/gag them (!pmute and !pgag). \n\nThe reason this is here, is because  if you are banned on Puzzle  your ban will  not  show on the Bans Page.\nThe only reason Puzzle shows on the Bans Page is so TTT bans are also on the server to keep cheaters, trolls, hackers and other various players out of the server. "}]}
