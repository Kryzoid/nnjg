I know a lot of people who were upset at his ban, including me. I think this was just a huge misunderstanding, from what he has told me at least. I hate to see people like Freelancer get banned from our community because he is such an active player, not only on TTT but on flood as well. I think a week ban was a little harsh, maybe a day would have sufficed."}]}
