If VIPs did what you guys are doing they would be demoted in minutes.\nIt used to be when you got slapped you stopped what you were doing, because it was  probally against the rules. Now it's just ignored as some Mod having fun.\n\nIf I see you slapping somebody then you better have a reason, because if you don't I'm going to kick you for abuse.\nNobody has ANY reason to slap them or anybody else 10 times in a row. The random slapping has been a growing problem that's been ignored, and frankly it's pissing me off.\nThis is starting today. I hope it's out of your system since you've been doing it nonstop for a month.\nI don't think I'm alone in this thinking. That Guy agrees with me, and Gash probaly would too if he saw how much you did it.\nSlapping is a tool for administration, not a toy. Long ago VIPs lost slap from doing the exact same thing. Now you guys are moderators. You were given your powers because we thought you could do the job the best.\nYou're proving us wrong right now. This abuse is showing us you aren't ready because you can't handle the temptation.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr: Fuck you. Read it. It's like 2 paragraphs.\n\n On a side note: Moderators, don't slap camping traitors. It gives them away. Send them a psay .\n\nEdit: To Clarify: you can still slap people who are stuck, Just don't do it for fun. "}]}
