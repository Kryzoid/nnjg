I can judge whether it was rdm or if they had a reason. Im generally one to give people chances to see if they are worthy of a ban. Ive been an admin about 2 or 3 times on team fortress 2 servers and i know how to displine people. I am 16 years of age and my voice is not sqeaky...lol that is all :)"},{"postId":12375,"topicId":1370,"posterId":385,"postTime":1293150671,"postText":"I think Katkong should get Admin.
