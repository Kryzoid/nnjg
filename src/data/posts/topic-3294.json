The game really didn't get good until you reached the level cap though when I played. The first 20 levels might be fun though I haven't tried the new ones, they usually try to make the starting zones pretty good. It's a fun game if you have money to spare and if you have friends to play it with, it's a lot better."},{"postId":26192,"topicId":3294,"posterId":48,"postTime":1311553792,"postText":"Yeah, I play it. \nIdk what you would do before 20... levelling is kind of boring after a while....\n\nLike Destar said, end game is where it really begins, and I'm probably xferring my main toon so I can play with a friend...\nplaying with friends is really a lot more fun.\nI basically just play it for endgame PvP, but I do admit paying monthly does suck.\n\nHowever, I got a job recently and I pay biyearly, so like.. 80 bucks for 6 months isn't terrible."}]}
