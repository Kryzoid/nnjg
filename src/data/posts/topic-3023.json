His next choice was to pick a name extremely similar to mine, kosing me whenever someone says Yoo Dang, saying thats what they said. He obviously used it to his advantage with his adv disguiser, targetting me and me alone for each and every disguise. Combine those with the fact he was pissed at me for banning him, and I have no choice to assume he came up with a well thought out way to troll. Trolling is attempting to cause an emotional response, and it was working. I asked Balenti to handle it, since I've already been ill all day yesterday and today, i've asked him to change his name. He refused untill Kobooold got him to... his next name was \"Yoo Dong Gay\". Now what does this sound like to you?\nI'm in game, so I did not upload the pic of his name change, but if he denies it, I will post it."},{"postId":24060,"topicId":3023,"posterId":68,"postTime":1308102915,"postText":"Post everything you want I posted what I had.

With a name like that you can't honestly expect people to call you zealot.
