There shouldn't be a problem just because of that. Second of all I was perma banned on 2 Garry's Mod accounts. The one I was using tonight and my other one (Which I just found out is banned apparently). So that one was banned for being in some group. It was some random gash hate or whatever group. It was my old account so I just accepted any requests and did not review the groups. So tonight I am playing and messing around in TTT, nothing against the rules I hope. After a while Pharaoh and a Quack join. I say hi to Quack and we talk a little about S3G. Next thing I know I'm banned. At first I thought it was a mistake so I went to the website and says it was for using another account. Honestly, I had no idea I was exploiting and apologise for joining a group and not further reviewing it. I really would like to be part of both communities. I don't see why Pharaoh didn't ask me about it. I was unaware of it at the time. Oh well. I would like to be unban.\n\nOn a side note I am making a game mode. Birdflu played on it in early development. I am releasing it, once it is finished, so if you would like to take a look I can give you the IP. I will be happy to give the game mode to you or anyone else who wants it."},{"postId":30541,"topicId":3743,"posterId":84,"postTime":1314070417,"postText":"I'm pretty sure that if you leave the group that caused your ban, it will be lifted."},{"postId":30543,"topicId":3743,"posterId":1024,"postTime":1314072803,"postText":"I'm not in the group on this account.

The reason for the ban was using an alt, even though Blue Kirby is your main, your actual alt was banned because of the group, so leaving should hopefully result in your secondary account and main account being unbanned."},{"postId":30550,"topicId":3743,"posterId":237,"postTime":1314075135,"postText":"I know i shouldn't post (although i did play with mr kirby today, and he was a gentleman and a scholar), but is it really that bad to be a member of s3g?"},{"postId":30551,"topicId":3743,"posterId":84,"postTime":1314075594,"postText":">> I know i shouldn't post (although i did play with mr kirby today, and he was a gentleman and a scholar), but is it really that bad to be a member of s3g? \nIt's not that being part of S3G is bad, it's just that there was some history between NNJG and S3G.

If you invite people to the group you get a chance to win or something, and the Gash Defamation League you get an extra chance or something. It's really just a desperate chance to get more members.\n\nOn topic: I also find it suspicious you're the leader of a trolling group."},{"postId":30570,"topicId":3743,"posterId":612,"postTime":1314104635,"postText":"I know this is not supposed to be here.

They also just added it because when I checked on it earlier yesterday it wasn't there. We actually just kicked someone out for giving the clan a bad image.
