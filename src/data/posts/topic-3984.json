I was jumping out of the map to explore and I told everyone to tell me when i was last human then I would slay myself. I didn't think that it would effect anyone and I am sorry if I did."},{"postId":32122,"topicId":3984,"posterId":101,"postTime":1315184611,"postText":"Ryancarson, I have told you many times to not go outside the map previously. Yet every round you insist on saying \"I'LL SLAY MYSELF WHEN LAST HUMAN\"\n\nThere's a reason we tell you not to do it. Someone else might see it and say \"Well if he's doing it I can too!\" and then THEY go outside the map.\n\nEarlier you flat out disobeyed the orders, and you said you were going to stop, last time."},{"postId":32171,"topicId":3984,"posterId":672,"postTime":1315205144,"postText":"So does this mean that im not being unbanned?"},{"postId":32381,"topicId":3984,"posterId":153,"postTime":1315313271,"postText":"Locked and Denied."}]}
