Don't use the excuse \"EVERYBODY ELSE WUS DOING IT\"\n\nI vote no Unban. You got a warning and you ignored it because \"You're a rebel\"."},{"postId":16330,"topicId":1979,"posterId":389,"postTime":1298498905,"postText":">> Your In-Game name: [NNJG]★Kilroy★|S3G|\nYour Steam ID: STEAM_0:1:25397468\nReason: Point-whoring\nLength of Ban/Date and time of ban: 3 days\nWhat server were you playing?:TTT\nWho banned you?:Gash\nWhy should we unban you?: Why do you think you should be unbanned?

Green Gator agreeable, and luigi was once a mod.\n\nJust had to clear things up. I told I assumed it was 3 days, im not sure if it is, but yeah.

I banned you for RDM, you killed two people, along with Neokiller, and left the server. A mod even confirmed the story. It was also a day ban, it will expire later on tonight. And also, 1 day bans = not appeal-able. Wait it out, it'll be up in a bit. \n\nIf an admin/mod wants to reopen this for further discussion, go for it. \n\nAlso, here is the thread:  http://www.nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1935 "}]}
