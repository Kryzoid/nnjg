I'm 16 years old and I use a mic whenever needed. I've been playing garry's mod for a total of 2 years and I have Team Fortress 2, Bioshock, Portal, Left 4 Dead 1 & 2, Half Life 2 (Episode 1 and 2), and some other games for PC. I have an Xbox360 (Katkong780) I usually play Fallout 3/New Vegas, Black Ops, MW2, Oblivion ect... I go to an early college academy in San Antonio, Texas. This means I'm getting an associates degree at the same time as my high school degree, which means I only play on the weekends unless I dont have homework or I have days off. I generally get all A's except sometimes in Algebra 2. I feel like ive said enough...Soooooo yeah lol bye :) (P.S. I hope to be an admin on the Jail Mod Server)"},{"postId":12510,"topicId":1365,"posterId":112,"postTime":1293255639,"postText":"Welcome to NNJG.
