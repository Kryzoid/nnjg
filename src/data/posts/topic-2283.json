I like building stuff but it sucks so much when I run out of a material and have to go farm more for 5-10 minutes. And materials for visual appeal like stone you actually have to smelt which takes even longer. Looking back at what I just typed I think it kind of makes me look lazy but oh well."},{"postId":18422,"topicId":2283,"posterId":456,"postTime":1301889598,"postText":"This is aimed to be a hybrid between survival and creative server, thus items have to be farmed with. However, with /home, and beds there is very little risk in going farming, so, ummm, farm for your materials. My personal castle is build using more than 30 STACKS (30x64) of hand-smelted smoothstone. It's not that big a deal :)"},{"postId":23848,"topicId":2283,"posterId":869,"postTime":1307913726,"postText":"You just need to put time in your buildings...."},{"postId":23850,"topicId":2283,"posterId":243,"postTime":1307914101,"postText":"Please don't bump old threads: this thread is over 2 months old."},{"postId":23851,"topicId":2283,"posterId":869,"postTime":1307914465,"postText":"I just viewed throught the mineraft posts :( I don't look at the time :O I just answer :P"}]}
