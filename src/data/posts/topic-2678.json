It happened right after I shot 2 prisoners. 1 had a knife out and was attacking me. the other may have been unarmed and it is possible that I accidentally killed him. I believe he may have been the one that banned me, as there was no warning. I was immediately blacklisted and banned, with the ban statement saying only that I was an ass.\n\nI have been playing on the server quite a bit the last few weeks and not once been warned of any issues with my behavior, including as a guard. I'd like to think this was a misunderstanding and not a child raging, though I don't know.\n\nThank you for your time. I do enjoy playing the server."},{"postId":21492,"topicId":2678,"posterId":521,"postTime":1305066015,"postText":"Wait whats your ingame name?
