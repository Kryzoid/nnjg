After that people claimed it was admin abuse. While i attempted to explain my actions, I gaged vercon for admin disrespect and accidentaly brought him to my position when exiting out of client menu. vercon rdmed me for that when he wasn't traitor. Next round when I was detective at the start of the round he killed me when he wasn't traitor then was killed by other innocents. I asked punked before i banned him to see if it was alright. After I banned vercon, he attempted to rage at via steam chat."},{"postId":13308,"topicId":1502,"posterId":68,"postTime":1293841155,"postText":"LET THE GUY BE!!!!!
