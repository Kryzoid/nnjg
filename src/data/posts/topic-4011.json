Our new website for bans can be found at http://nnjg.site.nfoservers.com/sb/\n\nNow, because of the switch, you soon won't be able to use any power you may have. Why? Because we are getting rid of ULX. We're using SourceMod, which means you need to PM me your steam id, current EMail, and a password for your SourceBans account before having any access. \nCurrently, you all still have ULX power, but by the end of the week, you will lose it. Hopefully, in time with a host change to avoid crashes.\n\n-Ben\n\nThis is the current list of people who have given me the required information:\n \nTweekie\nMarioDJW\nHuman Aimbot\n "},{"postId":32330,"topicId":4011,"posterId":115,"postTime":1315277989,"postText":"Some quick questions:\nWill there still be mod, admin, and super admin classes?\nWill supers be able to add VIPs in any way?\nWill bans via sourcebans now be global/just jail/optional?"},{"postId":32332,"topicId":4011,"posterId":153,"postTime":1315278193,"postText":"1) There will not be any differences except for the Immunity level(gash, can you confirm this)\n2) Only I will be able to add people to VIP\n3) They will be global."},{"postId":32342,"topicId":4011,"posterId":372,"postTime":1315279867,"postText":"With the switch to sourcebans, will blacklist finally be recorded somewhere, as in, the person who blacklisted them and possibly a reason?"},{"postId":32343,"topicId":4011,"posterId":735,"postTime":1315279959,"postText":">> With the switch to sourcebans, will blacklist finally be recorded somewhere, as in, the person who blacklisted them and possibly a reason? \nand will moderators be able to blacklist?"},{"postId":32346,"topicId":4011,"posterId":2,"postTime":1315280390,"postText":">> With the switch to sourcebans, will blacklist finally be recorded somewhere, as in, the person who blacklisted them and possibly a reason? \nNo. Blacklisting is separate to our Admin system.
