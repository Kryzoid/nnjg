Yeah, because spamming earlier \"DUMS A FAG DUMS A FAG DUMS A FAG\" not to mention you got 3 other people to do it, ISNT spamming.\n2. It's a traitorous act if you dont.\n3. It wasnt abusive, you rdmed me 12 times. Dont say \"it wasnt rdm\" because thats bullshit.\n4. They might be responsible for their own, but you influenced their decisions greatly.\n5. Theres a 50% chance you told other people to say things.\n6. You'd make a good politician when you grow up. Saying such bullshit and still people believe you.\n7.
