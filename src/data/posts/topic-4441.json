I don't quite understand what you are trying to communicate here, but a thing that lets you leave messages on the body that appear after they're searched would be cool.\n2. Good Idea, but not a very new one. inb4 body bomb.\n3. Maybe something that adds 1-2 more jumps to hands. No need to go crazy with having to code a whole new item/weapon.\n4. Rocket Jump already does this. l2rocketjump\n5. Advanced disguiser needs to take peoples shop items too, old idea, but still needs to be implemented.\n6. Very cool idea. A Lock rather than a lockpick that is visible on both sides of the door and can be destoryed."},{"postId":35081,"topicId":4441,"posterId":517,"postTime":1318103117,"postText":"Idea number 6 sounds awesome,"},{"postId":35093,"topicId":4441,"posterId":605,"postTime":1318110921,"postText":">> i feel like the ammount of wepons are nice that NNJG has to offer but i believe there should be more traitor abilitys to strike fear into innos such as:\n1.

I see so many Ts dieing while playing with this, that it wouldnt be funny anymore.\n2. I've seen too many a time when innos ignore unided bodies that are out of the way, just so they dont get blaimed for them, I'm not 100% how effective this could be, though I do like setting traps.\n3. Might as well buy the rocket jump.\n4. Again, might as well buy the rocket jump, just land better with it for no health loss :O!\n5. Something that has been mentioned many times, but I forget why it wasn't implemented.\n6. Now this peaks my interest, if this gets added, I'm so going to lock Gash and myself into a room and call it our special time. There will be no escape, he would be forced to enjoy the situation."},{"postId":35095,"topicId":4441,"posterId":1123,"postTime":1318117372,"postText":"Im glad i could get some positive feedback on some of the items\n@destar im trying to say here like a tool that would allow you to write on the walls with ropes, but the ropes could be in certain colors like you shoot at one spot so that marks the beginning point of the rope, then you shoot to where you want to make a straight line and shoot to the next direction, this being so that you could take the time to spell out \"Your next ______\" which would freak the crap out of me, it would also be able to make a trail to if u want to make a path to your victim, or frame someone thats in a room possibly, idk this could branch out but the traitor would automatically have this tool.\nAnd possibly to Item number 6, you nail the door or whatever so no one can get in or out until the door is damaged/ nails are shot or something you know.\nI also feel number 3: the grappling hook could be useful i mean i know on the map udane made changes too ive wanted to get on the building that has basically no use beside of the tallest building, i think throwing a grappling hook would be so ninja"},{"postId":35098,"topicId":4441,"posterId":612,"postTime":1318118822,"postText":">> Im glad i could get some positive feedback on some of the items\n@destar im trying to say here like a tool that would allow you to write on the walls with ropes, but the ropes could be in certain colors like you shoot at one spot so that marks the beginning point of the rope, then you shoot to where you want to make a straight line and shoot to the next direction, this being so that you could take the time to spell out \"Your next ______\" which would freak the crap out of me, it would also be able to make a trail to if u want to make a path to your victim, or frame someone thats in a room possibly, idk this could branch out but the traitor would automatically have this tool.\nAnd possibly to Item number 6, you nail the door or whatever so no one can get in or out until the door is damaged/ nails are shot or something you know.\nI also feel number 3: the grappling hook could be useful i mean i know on the map udane made changes too ive wanted to get on the building that has basically no use beside of the tallest building, i think throwing a grappling hook would be so ninja \n\n\nmyaybe an upgrade for magneeto rod"},{"postId":35256,"topicId":4441,"posterId":1097,"postTime":1318373195,"postText":"magneto rod upgrade gonna be what?
