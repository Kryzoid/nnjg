Also, get a pic. \n\nL does win all.\nMatt's pretty cool too, it's a shame he doesn't last long.\n\nNear and mello are both fgts though. \nL simply is the best out of all of them. Besides Light of course. Mello was too weird, even for me, and Near was to childish and over confident of himself, plus it was him that got my hero killed so I hate him."},{"postId":11276,"topicId":520,"posterId":242,"postTime":1290820249,"postText":"Shinnosuke Nohara - Crayon Shin Chan"},{"postId":12097,"topicId":520,"posterId":347,"postTime":1292696065,"postText":" http://i335.photobucket.com/albums/m462/Jman246g/Lelouch1.jpg \n\nLelouch From Code Geass"},{"postId":12425,"topicId":520,"posterId":204,"postTime":1293183205,"postText":"Haruhi suzumiya, from the melancholies of haruhi suzumiya. cause we have 2 things in common,\n http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081229231561/wikiality/images/5/51/Haruhi_official_916x1280.jpg \n1.annoying\n2.bossy as hell\nand because we're both ultra derectors!\norrr...

But hoooooly shit you should probably not bump a topic that hasn't been commented on for  8 MONTHS .  The official policy on dead threads is 2 months, you should read the forums rules .  Sorry if I came off a little harsh, but please do read them.  Welcome to the community, assuming you are intending to be a part of it.\n(Also, maybe this thread should be locked)\nEdit: How did anyone not see this until now?  Weird that he posted it 6 days ago, sorry if I'm guilty of dead thread bumping too."},{"postId":38015,"topicId":520,"posterId":373,"postTime":1321471902,"postText":"He could be a bot simply for the fact that he named Naruto, and the fact that \"ONLINE GED PROGRAM\" in his signature.\n\n/Locked"}]}
