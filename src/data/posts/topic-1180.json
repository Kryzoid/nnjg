When was that? When the admin was afk, dead to the world. Currently, I am playing on the server, and there are two or three players who seem incapable of not mic spamming and randomly killing prisoners. ((# 133 \"{Blur} ganzgunner little thief\" STEAM_0:0:32841757 40:37 209 0 active))\n\nThe thing is - we either need more admins, or we need the ones we have to be more active. I, personally, will gladly volunteer for the former. I play a couple hours today, and always during active spurts. People such as bearcats can confirm that I often act as a mediator in arguments between players, and I also have a few years admin experience in web-based games\n\nThe Jail Server is currently disfuntional without admins. Something as simple as adding an admin would definitely fix it. What do we have currently? A mass of honest players, drowning under the stifling mass of idiotic, free killing parasites. What could we have? An awesome server with alot more fun.\n\nIts you're choice.\n\nGlobey"},{"postId":11056,"topicId":1180,"posterId":55,"postTime":1290211568,"postText":"+SawPpArT"},{"postId":11164,"topicId":1180,"posterId":109,"postTime":1290477678,"postText":"Agreed."},{"postId":11345,"topicId":1180,"posterId":142,"postTime":1290912344,"postText":"Eh, mawd.
