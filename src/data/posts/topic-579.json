I hope you will reconsider your ban, Kryzoid, or at least give a good reason for the warningless permanent ban.\n\nSS of voteban: http://screenshot.xfire.com/s/102502156-4.jpg "},{"postId":5314,"topicId":579,"posterId":4,"postTime":1281594180,"postText":"I banned you because __Crisis asked for a super to do it anyways since his voteban failed and he would have banned you straight away if he could.

Come on, people get lucky once in a while. Just today while practicing with Kryzoid in TF2 I did a blind shot as a medic with a syringe gun in a small burst at a random CP which I couldn't see.

That is such a simple shot.  You say you have proof, can I please see this proof?\n\nOn a side note, would you like to explain why you shot me? I was expecting you to be traitor since, you know, you shot me as soon as the round started."},{"postId":5353,"topicId":579,"posterId":13,"postTime":1281652433,"postText":"People had been thinking he was aimbotting all night. Me and a Punk were on for a few hours and were spectating him, seemed susupicious and I thought there was a good chance he was, so did Punk, but I don't like to perm without 100% proof, and Punk doesn't like to perm at all so we did nothing. A few times he made shots that were completely outrageous. We have had CS:S freaks on before who can kill good, but it was like unbelievable trick shots over and over. If I remember correctly earlier that night you killed some guy 180 degrees behind you, while in the air, with a headshot.

You don't know me so I will forgive you for not knowing how I work, but in short, since they were there to take care of you, I don't need to stress my weak rig with recording demos.
