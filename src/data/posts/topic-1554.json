You can respond to this if you are interesting in seeing this, as it does make black ops a little less crappy. \nSome features i added/details:\n-base gamemode is search and destroy\n-killstreaks disabled\n-sprinting disabled\n-double health\n-no health regen\n-reduced damage\n-same accuracy firing from hip as from scoped\n-no custom classes, i premade 10 classes using the most popular css guns\n-classes include: useless perks, other than steady aim, see above\n-i use a python, speed loader to emulate deagle\n-other pistols used are to emulate the dual wield pistols on terrorist side, and the last pistol on ct side\n-scout is emulated by a lowered power l96, withof course, variable zoom\n-no respawning\n-no one hit kill bodyshots\n-much, much more! Please talk to me and help me test it!"},{"postId":18124,"topicId":1554,"posterId":586,"postTime":1301538702,"postText":"I would LOVE to test this, really.\nAlso, what about melee?\nEquipable knifes?"},{"postId":18126,"topicId":1554,"posterId":2,"postTime":1301541024,"postText":"Please don't bump old threads."}]}
