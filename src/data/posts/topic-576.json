Unfurtunatley only me and Link were the only ones that could do anything about it. I assumed they were all friends because they would turn down every vote kick and voteban against someone. They got gagged or muted due to use of excessive profanity, racism, micspam they and even then they could just leave and rejoin. A vote ban or kick for rdm 3-4 rdms a round would be turned down because they never voted yes. They would also troll the younger players using mic such as Link and Tabraz. They then lead everyone to rtv during the round causing a map change mid-round. There is only 3 mods? Deth, Brando and Crisis (I'm sorry if I left anyone out ;D), and most don't play often.
