I guess not.\n\nAnyways, you HAVE to take screenshots if you want a successful ban request. You can take one by pressing F5 or binding a key to \"jpeg\"\n\nI have mine binded to J (j for jpeg, trolol), it's a good key."},{"postId":11278,"topicId":1226,"posterId":128,"postTime":1290833481,"postText":"First of all, I don't remember doing that. Second, that vote doesn't affect anything at all. Obviously if your last words were \"JoshJosh is traitor\" then people would try to kill me. This vote is the equivalent of saying in chat \"I'm not a traitor\" which is just a lie, and nobody would really believe it. And IIRC I was killed anyway."},{"postId":11279,"topicId":1226,"posterId":2,"postTime":1290835755,"postText":"This is for Dark's Shitver."}]}
