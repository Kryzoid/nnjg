Eventually, a certain easteregg(s) of some sort was updated into each game and if you found 36 of them, you'd get a golden potato, like i did. The 13 indie games were in a pack called the \"Potato sack\". This is why there is a big reference to potatoes in portal 2. Everyone with a Golden Potato by the release of Portal 2 also received the entire Valve Complete Pack (including Portal 2) for free.\n\nSorry for the haste explanation, it's actually way deeper than this, including a few in-real-life stunts and a hacked Gabe Newell e-mail--as well as steam account takeovers by GLaDOS.
