Considering that nothing is quite rare... look anywhere you want... there is always something there. Even in space there is both the force of gravity and presence of time. For there to be trully noting is somthing of its own. And it makes sence that if you have a blob of nothing next to another blob of nothing you wouldn't be able to tell the two apart... So there, Math works with the world."},{"postId":18573,"topicId":2256,"posterId":612,"postTime":1302136452,"postText":"SHUT UP. IF YOU DIVIDE BY ZERO, bad shit is bound to happen."}]}
