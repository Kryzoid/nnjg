This all depends on if you want the object to move left to right/forward to back, If you want it to follow a preset path involving more then one direction(s). Or if you want it to rotate.\nThe first method, involves a func_movelinear. Set the amount of distance it needs to travel. Name it. Then go into its I/Os, and add one for on open, close. Add one for on close, open. Lastly, using a logic_auto entity, go into it's I/Os and select, on mapspawn, open.\nSecond method requires a func_tracktrain, im not much for this myself, so i suggest getting a tutorial.\nLast one requires a func_rotating. All it requires to be set on, and the speed it rotates at.\n\nI believe I'll make a tutorial on this and some other extras for puzzle mapping later on.\n\nP.S. I also love how you set up your name in the map like I would :o"},{"postId":34238,"topicId":4305,"posterId":612,"postTime":1316935272,"postText":"I learned from the best!"},{"postId":34261,"topicId":4305,"posterId":243,"postTime":1316973081,"postText":"I suggest awesome lighting, nuff said."},{"postId":34711,"topicId":4305,"posterId":612,"postTime":1317584837,"postText":"Decided to hold off on this until I'm a little more skilled.
