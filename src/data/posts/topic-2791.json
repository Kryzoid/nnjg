I'll pay $20 for a coder to make it work, and we can test it on the flood server, as no one is using it. Source Bans is easier, more powerful, and local(not easyban.net)\nIt also looks better.\n\nThoughts?"},{"postId":22425,"topicId":2791,"posterId":112,"postTime":1306066708,"postText":"The main reason I like source bans is it shows previous bans."},{"postId":22427,"topicId":2791,"posterId":115,"postTime":1306070726,"postText":">> The main reason I like source bans is it shows previous bans. \nYes.\n\nIt looks much more professional as well.
