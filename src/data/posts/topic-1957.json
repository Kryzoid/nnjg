I suggest fm_buildaboat_bsu yeah, it's BSU's but who gives a fuck.\n\n2) Remove 90% of weapons, props, and powerups. They ruin flood. It should be simple, but keep some variety.\nFor instance: the TV gun, which not only is broken, but is just plain stupid.\n\n3) Get GOOD, FAIR, ACTIVE moderators who can do their job well. Good administration=Good server\n\n4) Add prop protection Toxic said he would, but he never got around to it. Ask him again? Noone likes being welded to the ground.\n\n5) PLAY THE SERVER! We need players who play a fair amount. You don't have to play 100% of the time, but maybe join every once in a while, and wait until 3 or so more people join, then leave so there are players on. As soon as ONE person joins, more will follow. The problem is noone wants to be the first and only player on a flood server.\n\n6) ENJOY IT! Have fun on the server. It's just a game!\n\n7) Demote abusive admins with no warnings. I hate abuse.\n\nI think this should go into effect very soon\nWhat do you think?"},{"postId":16207,"topicId":1957,"posterId":2,"postTime":1298250539,"postText":"I love the current flood...\n\nWhat are you smoking :(\nBut yes, a lot of shit needs to be fixed/re-done. For example:\nRemove the gamemode's prop protection. That breaks FPP. FPP is on the server. FPP collides with the gamemode's prop protection that isn't finished.\n\nAdd FPP options on the Spawn menu, delete shitty weapons, new scoreboard, add the Shop jail and TTT use, but edited to give the winner 25 points."},{"postId":16212,"topicId":1957,"posterId":4,"postTime":1298254129,"postText":">> Ben\":1n26qtgp]3) Get GOOD, FAIR, ACTIVE moderators who can do their job well.
