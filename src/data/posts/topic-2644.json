But if we added that i would recommend something like.\n\nfirst use 1 point to buy\nsecond use 2 points to buy\nthird 3 points to buy\nAnd so forth.\n\nSo in order to keep buying a 1 shot kill, you would need a butt loud of traitor points. This would also help in the means of traitors sharing points to work as a team better. To code this all you would need to do if you cant increase buy costs, is add more knife weapons to the traitor menu with increased costs.\nKnife\nDagger\nFalcon Knife :)"},{"postId":21199,"topicId":2644,"posterId":763,"postTime":1304884290,"postText":"@ Crisis wouldn't that be advantage of using a knife lots of people have crap load of points and this is Bowsa and gash use Machete i like it ^_^"},{"postId":21200,"topicId":2644,"posterId":79,"postTime":1304885312,"postText":"You think its a advantage, but to get 3 points total, if u start with one. u have to get 4-5 people killed + kill the detective yourself. thats just to use the knife twice. In order for a third knife, you'd need another detective kill and around 10 inno's killed. so 2 detectives and roughly 14-16 players dead. Thats a fully packed game for 3 knives.
