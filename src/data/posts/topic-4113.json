Sometime in May.\nWhat server were you playing?: Jail, Flood, and I also played Trouble in Terrorist Town\nWho banned you?: I have no idea.\nWhy should we unban you?: Well, I was playing the server. When this REAL annoying kid came on. I got banned for bullying him, and requesting his ban on another server. I lost it, and requested to be banned. After I was finally banned, it was actually hard. Every other server sucked. I tried creating my own, and I failed. To be honest, it's been awhile. We all make mistakes. I am actually sorry for how I behaved, and how I overreacted. Other then my own server, I couldn't find anywhere else on GMod.\n\nI really ask for a unban, and I am sincerely sorry. Please, forgive me.\n\nThank you if you forgive me, if not, well, was nice to see this place again.. nice redesign by the way!"},{"postId":34407,"topicId":4113,"posterId":54,"postTime":1317096567,"postText":"Well, this thread is old but, you're not banned sooo."}]}
