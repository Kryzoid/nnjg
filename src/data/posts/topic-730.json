We were thinking about what it would take to build one from the ground up, then after some research and found someone who used to run a team that was already making one. They disbanded about a year ago, but he is still very much interested in making it happen. I was gonna talk to Ben Gash and Bird about it later, but I don't want to wait so I am announcing it. I know we love Death Note here, and I'm sure there are people that want to see i happen. Of course I have to wait for approval, but I would want anyone with the know how of making game modes and custom content to get on board with us, or anyone who can help in any way.
