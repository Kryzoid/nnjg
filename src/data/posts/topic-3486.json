Also, validating files has never helped me in the least. Is the file there, check, lets move on.\n\nChanging the name of the gmod folder is the same as just reinstalling it practically. It's better to reinstall though since some files that are saved even when renaming the folder might be corrupt and cause issues further down the line. Also make sure if you did just rename the folder that you verify files anyway (useless to do but meh) and also scan your computer for fragmentation."}]}
