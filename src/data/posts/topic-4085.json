A lot of people get along very well. It makes the servers so much better when everyone is getting along, being friends, and having a damn good time. This may seem like I'm just saying this, but I'm not. We, are seriously one of the best communities. I love all of you!"},{"postId":32917,"topicId":4085,"posterId":82,"postTime":1315702901,"postText":"Thank you kind sire!
