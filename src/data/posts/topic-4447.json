Once there we decided to create a Town, its name is Xalton, and it is on the island of Raffrica. On this topic, we will post the future buildings that will occur in Xalton, so that all of the towns people will know where and what the town buildings are, and will be.\n-------------------------------------------\nCurrent (town) Constructions: N/A\n-------------------------------------------\nCompleted Constructions list and features:\n- Town Hall, 5 rooms, 2 floors, over 4000 blocks, features a Courtroom, Conference room, Main office, Library, and Secondary offices. It was constructed from donated blocks partly and some of my personal blocks. Eclipse helped mainly with the interior and first and second floors. I completed the roof late that night. The land was provided by FunnyRaff, and cleared by He and I and was an idea of all of ours here in Xalton, and if I forgot to mention your helping in the construction, please say.\n-------------------------------------------\nGuys, if you have any more ideas, no matter how unusual, please reply to this topic. In the next week following, I'll have alot of time on my hands and can build plenty of things.\nI'll update the topic when I get permission to build something within the city of Xalton, this week I'd like to complete my new Manor outside of Xalton and will be busy."},{"postId":35303,"topicId":4447,"posterId":612,"postTime":1318447415,"postText":"can we occupy that place? i will help construction if we can live there, just know that my house will be a mansion"},{"postId":35310,"topicId":4447,"posterId":377,"postTime":1318455976,"postText":"An Art Museum?

We (at least I) have never done that. If a new person wants to go to xalton, they must be guided there by a person who knows how to get there. That makes it so that the trek to get there from CC will make them treasure more the fact that they are there."},{"postId":36536,"topicId":4447,"posterId":249,"postTime":1319750911,"postText":"I told them to ask for it ;-;"}]}
