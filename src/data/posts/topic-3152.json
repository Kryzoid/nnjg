This is weird to me because all my other programs that use the internet work, i play with a few friends and we talk over teamspeak and when i loose connection i can still talk on teamspeak well and browse the internet and it works with no flaws. I have one mod installed and its a weapon pack. I can also run high quality games such as crossfire and other non steam games with no flaws. Does anyone know a solution to this problem? Its probably something very simple but im a computer noob."},{"postId":25088,"topicId":3152,"posterId":373,"postTime":1309494607,"postText":"-snip-"},{"postId":25091,"topicId":3152,"posterId":705,"postTime":1309495986,"postText":"GOOGLE.com"},{"postId":25095,"topicId":3152,"posterId":237,"postTime":1309501139,"postText":"on a serious note...i find that when my internet is blowing, if i reset my modem and wireless router, it usually helps for a day or two."}]}
