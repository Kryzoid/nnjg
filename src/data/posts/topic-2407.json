So basically, we need to re-write them.\n\nI'll re-write them so they sound good and official, i just need the one-word terms we use for each of them. So  I need you guys to remember the old rules, and post them for me. \n\nAfter I type out all of the rules, I want us all to revise the rules. This will be step 2 of the remake of jail rules. This will include adding new rules, editing current rules, and getting rid of rules altogether.  We have not gotten to this part yet, so please do not suggest new rules yet. \n\n\nSo far the rules I have (some are kind of regular server rules, but w/e):\nNo freekilling/rdming\nNo gunplanting\nNo teamkilling\nNo chatspam\nNo micspam\nNo trolling\nNo encouraging freekill/rdm\nNo admin impersonation\nNo ghosting\nNo treating somebody different based on what the did last round.\nNo trucing. (Letting certain prisoners have weapons/more rights unless its their LR)\nNo giving Last requests involving Rdm. (ex. Asking your entire team to be killed last round.)\nNo kills days. (ex. Everybody gets into the airlock or gets shot)\nNo impossible orders. (ex. No moving, No touching the ground)\nYou cannot kill somebody for having a weapon they can't drop.\nYou cannot tell somebody to put away their fists.\nDo NOT kill the last person before giving them a last request, unless they don't get one. They lose it by\n-Being disguised while another prisoner is giving the LR\n-Attacking the guards instead of giving it.\nNo Admin Disrepect\nNo freetranqing\nNo exploit/hacking\nNo racism\nNo saying the server sucks\nNo loopholes(Example: Okay guards, let's have a friendly guard shooting day)\nTreat disguised guards as actual guards\n\nThanks for cooperating and helping!\n\n\nQuack"},{"postId":19228,"topicId":2407,"posterId":54,"postTime":1303095257,"postText":"No ghosting\nNo constant cussing (not an official rule; but I think it should be)"},{"postId":19237,"topicId":2407,"posterId":101,"postTime":1303104094,"postText":">> No ghosting\nNo constant cussing (not an official rule; but I think it should be) \n\nAs long as that's limited to the \"XBox LIVE\" user amount.\n\nExample: Fuck those cunt bitches, that fucking asshole killed me, ain't that right ya little fuckfuckfuckfuck.\n\n\nAnd pretty much talking like that 100% of the time."},{"postId":19268,"topicId":2407,"posterId":3,"postTime":1303147060,"postText":"If you disrespect an admin, they get to choose your punishment.\nIf you say the server sucks, you will be permanently banned and not missed.\nIf you freetranq, I will get really pissed.\nIf you exploit/hack, you will be permanently banned.\nIf you are racist, you will be permanently banned."},{"postId":19271,"topicId":2407,"posterId":112,"postTime":1303151010,"postText":"No treating somebody different based on what the did last round.\nNo trucing.
