I am looking forward to see what they do with the game further down the road, in the latest video, they stated that cities are made up of different maps, and that Berlin may be made up of 80 maps connected, that has me more excited than any other game so far this year!\n\n It combines a first person shooter with an overarching strategy system, best of all you can sign up for the alpha and help direct the development of the game! \n\nOfficial Website \nVideos \n\nScreenshots:\n http://i.imgur.com/EMJSf.jpg \n http://i.imgur.com/OzYly.jpg \n http://i.imgur.com/51dzL.jpg "}]}
