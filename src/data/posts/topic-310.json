SOMETHIGN MEAN TO ME\n(13:11:26) Ungrateful_Dead: Your being a hyporcite and an idiot right now\n(13:11:35) ๖Mr._Gash: You are too.\n(13:11:41) ๖Mr._Gash: Insulting the co-owner?\n(13:11:47) ๖Mr._Gash: I think that falls under \"Idiot\".\n(13:12:04) ๖Mr._Gash: He is not getting unbanned, deal with it.\n(13:12:08) ๖Mr._Gash: He chose to be banned.\n(13:12:16) ๖Mr._Gash: I gave him more then 1 warning.\n(13:13:41) DethSlayr: hmm :/\n(13:13:42) ๖Mr._Gash: Just wondering, how am I being a hypocrite?\n(13:15:06) Ungrateful_Dead: You use aimbots\n(13:15:11) Ungrateful_Dead: -_-\n(13:15:20) ๖Mr._Gash: No, I didn't use an aimbot.\n(13:15:38) ๖Mr._Gash: I told everyone that I knew who had them, and even if you're admin I will ban you for using one.\n(13:15:41) ๖Mr._Gash: I didn't use mine.\n(13:15:44) ๖Mr._Gash: Rain said no.\n(13:15:47) ๖Mr._Gash: And kept using it.\n(13:16:02) Ungrateful_Dead: He has to restart for a script to stop working\n(13:16:10) Ungrateful_Dead: Maybe he didn't feel like restarting\n(13:16:13) Ungrateful_Dead: Seriously\n(13:16:19) Ungrateful_Dead: Your taking one incident\n(13:16:19) ๖Mr._Gash: No, he said he didn't want to delete it.\n(13:16:39) ๖Mr._Gash: I kicked him, saying to turn it off or delete it, and he didn't bother to rejoin or delete it.\n(13:16:43) Ungrateful_Dead: HE didn't want to delete it because he'd have to restart gmod\n(13:16:57) DethSlayr: So rain isnt getting unbanned? :/\n(13:16:58) Ungrateful_Dead: If he didn't bother to rejoin then why did you ban him\n(13:17:06) ๖Mr._Gash: Obviously you don't have scripts, because you don't have to restart gmod for things like that to take affect.\n(13:17:08) Ungrateful_Dead: If he didn't rejoin maybe he was deleting it\n(13:17:15) Ungrateful_Dead: Actually I do\n(13:17:19) Ungrateful_Dead: And I have to restart\n(13:17:20) ๖Mr._Gash: I told him over steam to delete them then he can rejoin.\n(13:17:25) ๖Mr._Gash: He said no.\n(13:17:38) ๖Mr._Gash: Also, are they in addon format?\n(13:17:42) Ungrateful_Dead: Holy crap gash\n(13:17:44) ๖Mr._Gash: You never have to restart gmod for it.\n(13:17:46) Ungrateful_Dead: He stayed off the server\n(13:17:51) Ungrateful_Dead: Why was it suddenly your business\n(13:17:56) ๖Mr._Gash: After he was kicked.\n(13:18:01) Ungrateful_Dead: Yes\n(13:18:09) Ungrateful_Dead: Was he on the server with the script after that\n(13:18:10) Ungrateful_Dead: No\n(13:18:13) ๖Mr._Gash: It automatical​ly works once you join due to the way he had it.\n(13:18:14) Ungrateful_Dead: No he wasn't\n(13:18:18) Ungrateful_Dead: He took his warning\n(13:18:20) ๖Mr._Gash: He refused to delete it.\n(13:18:24) ๖Mr._Gash: No.\n(13:18:27) ๖Mr._Gash: He took the ban.\n(13:18:30) Ungrateful_Dead: It doesn't matter\n(13:18:31) ๖Mr._Gash: I told him to delete it or be banned.\n(13:18:33) Ungrateful_Dead: It's his computer\n(13:18:36) Ungrateful_Dead: He can keep the script\n(13:18:39) ๖Mr._Gash: He said he wasn't going to delete it.\n(13:18:43) Ungrateful_Dead: As long as he doesn't use it on the server\n(13:18:50) ๖Mr._Gash: If he wants to be at NNJG, he has to delete it.\n(13:18:53) Ungrateful_Dead: Gash you're completely missign the point\n(13:18:54) ๖Mr._Gash: He said no to deleting it.\n(13:19:08) Ungrateful_Dead: As long as he wasn't on the server actively using iut, it doesn't matter nad is none of your business\n(13:19:22) ๖Mr._Gash: But he WAS using it.\n(13:19:28) ๖Mr._Gash: Once he joins HE IS USING IT.\n(13:19:28) Ungrateful_Dead: He WAS\n(13:19:31) Ungrateful_Dead: Then you gave him a warning\n(13:19:33) ๖Mr._Gash: It is an AUTORUN script.\n(13:19:36) Ungrateful_Dead: And he didn't rejoin with it\n(13:19:43) ๖Mr._Gash: Because I banned him.\n(13:19:46) Ungrateful_Dead: Now if he rejoined with the script\n(13:19:49) Ungrateful_Dead: EXACTLY\n(13:20:09) Ungrateful_Dead: Gash, stop, you're acting like an idiot now\n(13:20:15) Ungrateful_Dead: You banned him after giving him a warning?\n(13:20:23) Ungrateful_Dead: Whats the logic behind that\n(13:20:24) ๖Mr._Gash: He refused to follow the warning.\n(13:20:36) Ungrateful_Dead: Thats like saying, do it again and I'll punch you in the face\n(13:20:45) Ungrateful_Dead: And then punchign someone in the face before they can do it again\n(13:21:02) Ungrateful_Dead: He couldn't follow the warnign because you wouldn't let him back on the server\n(13:21:04) ๖Mr._Gash: Ungrateful, you don't get it.\n(13:21:08) ๖Mr._Gash: The kick wasn't the warning.\n(13:21:08) Ungrateful_Dead: Yes\n(13:21:12) Ungrateful_Dead: I get it perfectly well\n(13:21:22) Ungrateful_Dead: Are you forgetting all the good hes done for the server too?\n(13:21:30) Ungrateful_Dead: And you;re bannign him because he used a script?\n(13:21:32) ๖Mr._Gash: Like what?\n(13:21:40) Ungrateful_Dead: Moderation\n(13:21:47) ๖Mr._Gash: He never moderates.\n(13:21:48) Ungrateful_Dead: He certianly was the best moderator on the server\n(13:21:51) Ungrateful_Dead: I can tell you that much\n(13:21:54) ๖Mr._Gash: He just messes with the admin mod.\n(13:21:54) Ungrateful_Dead: Yes\n(13:21:56) Ungrateful_Dead: He does\n(13:21:58) Ungrateful_Dead: No\n(13:22:01) Ungrateful_Dead: He doesn't\n(13:22:16) Ungrateful_Dead: Alright, show of hands for everyone listening to this argument,\n(13:22:18) ๖Mr._Gash: \"Yes\" \"He does\" \"No\" \"He doesn't\"\n(13:22:21) ๖Mr._Gash: Decide what you're saying.\n(13:22:22) Ungrateful_Dead: How many people thought rain was a good mod?\n(13:22:44) ๖Mr._Gash: Well, I don't see anyone saying he is.\n(13:22:54) ๖Mr._Gash: Was.\n(13:22:56) Ungrateful_Dead: How many people ARE listening to this argument\n(13:23:01) ๖Mr._Gash: 0.\n(13:23:03) DethSlayr: i like rain, but i never really saw him moderate...\n(13:23:04) Weezer209: Me\n(13:23:15) Ungrateful_Dead: More to the point\n(13:23:28) Ungrateful_Dead: You can't ban someone for somethign they're not doing\n(13:23:29) Weezer209: I met Rain my first time ever on NNJG Flood, I liked him, but he never really \"Moderated\"\n(13:23:33) Ungrateful_Dead: If he left the server\n(13:23:38) Ungrateful_Dead: And stopped using the script on the server\n(13:23:44) Ungrateful_Dead: You can not ban him for that script on that server\n(13:23:46) Ungrateful_Dead: Period\n(13:23:52) Ungrateful_Dead: This is common sense\n(13:23:54) ๖Mr._Gash: Yes.\n(13:23:55) ๖Mr._Gash: I can.\n(13:24:04) Weezer209: Was he cheating>\n(13:24:05) ๖Mr._Gash: The point is\n(13:24:05) Ungrateful_Dead: You can't warn someone and then ban them immediatly afterwards\n(13:24:10) ๖Mr._Gash: He was going to rejoin when I left.\n(13:24:13) ๖Mr._Gash: He's done it before.\n(13:24:20) Ungrateful_Dead: Then temp ban him\n(13:24:21) ๖Mr._Gash: So I told him to delete it or be banned.\n(13:24:22) Ungrateful_Dead: don't perma\n(13:24:33) ๖Mr._Gash: He didn't listen to one of my several warnings.\n(13:24:36) Ungrateful_Dead: Temp ban insures he wont use the script anytime soon\n(13:24:45) Ungrateful_Dead: And if he does it again\n(13:24:49) Ungrateful_Dead: Then proceed to a perma\n(13:24:52) Ungrateful_Dead: But he didn't\n(13:24:57) Ungrateful_Dead: You just banned him\n(13:25:00) Weezer209: Personally, I think Rain should be stripped of any and all powers.\n(13:25:10) Weezer209: yBut allowed back on\n(13:25:30) Weezer209: My opinion prolly doesnt matter though.\n(13:25:31) ๖Mr._Gash: Ungrateful, the point is, he was exploiting. The gamemode couldn't have scriptenfor​cer due to the hosting ben has\n(13:25:40) ๖Mr._Gash: So I couldn't make him NOT use it besides banning him.\n(13:25:59) Weezer209: If he was cheating then I think a ban was resonable.\n(13:26:07) ๖Mr._Gash: Exactly.\n(13:26:07) Ungrateful_Dead: THEN TEMP BAN\n(13:26:13) Ungrateful_Dead: DON'T PERMA\n(13:26:21) Ungrateful_Dead: If he does it again\n(13:26:23) DethSlayr: well, this aregument is going nowhere :/\n(13:26:24) Ungrateful_Dead: you move onto perma\n(13:26:29) DethSlayr: argument*\n(13:26:30) Weezer209: It makes NNJG look bad when one of our OWN Moderators is cheating...​.\n(13:26:51) Ungrateful_Dead: You're kidding right?\n(13:26:52) ๖Mr._Gash: If he is cheating, then he is going to be banned. He should know better then to be cheating on one of our own servers.\n(13:26:56) Ungrateful_Dead: Mods cheat all the time\n(13:27:00) Ungrateful_Dead: Justn ot always with scripts\n(13:27:14) ๖Mr._Gash: Okay, example?\n(13:27:15) Perm'd_bitch: Ain't it fun.\n(13:27:18) Ungrateful_Dead: But the point is\n(13:27:25) Ungrateful_Dead: Oh HI RAIN\n(13:27:30) Ungrateful_Dead: JUST TALKIN BOUT YA\n(13:27:34) Perm'd_bitch: Mhm.\n(13:27:39) Ungrateful_Dead: Example: Slaying\n(13:27:41) Ungrateful_Dead: Slapping\n(13:27:45) Ungrateful_Dead: Etc.\n(13:27:46) Ungrateful_Dead: Etc.\n(13:27:49) ๖Mr._Gash: That's not cheating.\n(13:27:55) Ungrateful_Dead: Yes\n(13:28:00) Perm'd_bitch: Is giving yourself weapons, Gash.\n(13:28:03) Ungrateful_Dead: It is\n(13:28:08) ๖Mr._Gash: The client that was slapped/sla​yed, had a reason to get that punishment.\n(13:28:08) Perm'd_bitch: Exactily.\n(13:28:17) Ungrateful_Dead: Oh really\n(13:28:21) Ungrateful_Dead: So I f I could slay\n(13:28:21) ๖Mr._Gash: Sure, I admit I give myself weapons, but only when there are around 6 people on.\n(13:28:24) Ungrateful_Dead: And I'm traitor\n(13:28:27) Ungrateful_Dead: And I slay everyone\n(13:28:29) Perm'd_bitch: Its still abuse, Gash.\n(13:28:30) Ungrateful_Dead: Thats not cheating\n(13:28:39) Ungrateful_Dead: The people who got slayed deserved it\n(13:28:44) Ungrateful_Dead: Is that what you're saying gash\n(13:28:46) ๖Mr._Gash: Yeah, but I'm not using a cheat script to see where everyone is.\n(13:28:53) ๖Mr._Gash: Yes, actually, I am.\n(13:29:03) Perm'd_bitch: Well i wasnt using a cheat script to automatical​ly aim and shoot at peoples head.\n(13:29:05) ๖Mr._Gash: We only slay if the person was killing without a reason.\n(13:29:06) Ungrateful_Dead: Well then you're fuckign retarded\n(13:29:14) Perm'd_bitch: I wasn't using a script to see who were traitors.\n(13:29:23) ๖Mr._Gash: Ungrateful, you aren't looking at the reason why the person was slayed.\n(13:29:24) Ungrateful_Dead: Sure, because you can't slay for other reasons, can you Gash\n(13:29:28) ๖Mr._Gash: You're only looking at the outcome.\n(13:29:33) Perm'd_bitch: I refused to delete it, So i got rightfully banned from the server.\n(13:29:43) Perm'd_bitch: Then you again, told me to delete it.\n(13:29:46) Perm'd_bitch: nonstop\n(13:29:52) Perm'd_bitch: and started to threat to perma.\n(13:29:57) Perm'd_bitch: Which i won't stand for.\n(13:29:58) Ungrateful_Dead: Its his computer, he doesn't have to delete\n(13:29:59) Weezer209: My head is spinning\n(13:30:00) ๖Mr._Gash: I didn't permanently ban you the first time rain.\n(13:30:04) Ungrateful_Dead: He can do whatever he wants with it\n(13:30:06) Perm'd_bitch: Yeah\n(13:30:07) ๖Mr._Gash: I kicked you with the reason \"Banned\"\n(13:30:08) Perm'd_bitch: The second time.\n(13:30:16) Perm'd_bitch: Alright.\n(13:30:20) Perm'd_bitch: I wasnt going to rejoin\n(13:30:21) ๖Mr._Gash: I never permanently banned you when you were on the server.\n(13:30:22) Ungrateful_Dead: If hes not going to be able to get on the server\n(13:30:27) ๖Mr._Gash: I had to get your steamID from the logs.\n(13:30:28) Perm'd_bitch: So why keep on telling me to?\n(13:30:36) Ungrateful_Dead: Its not within your jurastictio​n to tell him what scripts he can and can't have\n(13:30:38) Perm'd_bitch: why did you perma after you kicked?\n(13:30:39) Weezer209: yUngrateful​....your right, iuts his computer...​but it is NNJG's server and if they dont want cheaters then they can ban\n(13:30:41) Perm'd_bitch: hm?\n(13:30:42) ๖Mr._Gash: Because if you did, you could keep playing on our servers.\n(13:30:48) Perm'd_bitch: Yeah\n(13:30:52) Perm'd_bitch: with SCRIPT ENFORCERS\n(13:30:58) ๖Mr._Gash: At first I didn't even say to delete it.\n(13:31:00) Perm'd_bitch: i count on them so the esp won't activate.\n(13:31:04) Perm'd_bitch: Actually\n(13:31:07) ๖Mr._Gash: Rain, Ben uses a weird server host.\n(13:31:10) Perm'd_bitch: in inferno, before you kicked me\n(13:31:14) Ungrateful_Dead: You know what Gash, stop being a stubborn bitch and listen\n(13:31:15) Perm'd_bitch: you told me to delete.\n(13:31:18) Ungrateful_Dead: If you're going to warn someoen\n(13:31:24) Ungrateful_Dead: YOu can't ban immediatly afterwards\n(13:31:26) ๖Mr._Gash: Due to him not having fast download, and the servers'' base gamemodes being fucked, I couldn't have script enforcer.\n(13:31:36) Perm'd_bitch: YOu turned it on earlier.\n(13:31:41) Ungrateful_Dead: Just TEMP ban then\n(13:31:43) Ungrateful_Dead: Say\n(13:31:48) ๖Mr._Gash: We all had a script on.\n(13:31:48) Ungrateful_Dead: You;re banned for a week then\n(13:31:51) Ungrateful_Dead: Or something like that\n(13:31:51) Perm'd_bitch: Ungrateful\n(13:31:55) Ungrateful_Dead: Don't ban him forever\n(13:31:59) Perm'd_bitch: esp/norecoi​l is a permaban\n(13:32:01) ๖Mr._Gash: I have 2 autorun scripts on my gmod, the aimbot and radar, but I had to disable them.\n(13:32:12) Perm'd_bitch: yeah, i couldnt disable\n(13:32:14) Ungrateful_Dead: Sure you do\n(13:32:17) Perm'd_bitch: its not optional.\n(13:32:21) Perm'd_bitch: its always on.\n(13:32:26) ๖Mr._Gash: So I said to delete or move it to your lua folder.\n(13:32:28) Perm'd_bitch: difference is if the server has enforcer.\n(13:32:34) ๖Mr._Gash: If you move it to your lua folder you have to use a command to open it.\n(13:32:37) Perm'd_bitch: Yeah, I said no to delete.\n(13:32:45) Perm'd_bitch: it has no commands.\n(13:32:46) ๖Mr._Gash: You never moved it.\n(13:32:54) Ungrateful_Dead: How do you know\n(13:32:54) Perm'd_bitch: its either autorun or won't work.\n(13:32:56) ๖Mr._Gash: Rain, if you move it to your lua folder\n(13:33:00) Ungrateful_Dead: HOW do you know he never moved it\n(13:33:05) Ungrateful_Dead: You have no proof sayign he didn't\n(13:33:10) Perm'd_bitch: Ungrateful\n(13:33:13) Perm'd_bitch: I said i won't\n(13:33:18) Perm'd_bitch: don't try to get technical\n(13:33:18) ๖Mr._Gash: then you have to type \"lua_opensc​ript_cl <espname>.l​ua\"\n(13:33:25) ๖Mr._Gash: In console.\n(13:33:31) ๖Mr._Gash: You dont need a command from the script to do so.\n(13:33:32) Perm'd_bitch: Yeah, i didnt know that.\n(13:33:38) Perm'd_bitch: I thought if you moved it to lua\n(13:33:45) Ungrateful_Dead: Well there you have it\n(13:33:47) Perm'd_bitch: you would have to move it back to autorun when you wanted to use it.\n(13:33:50) Perm'd_bitch: so i said no.\n(13:33:50) Ungrateful_Dead: Misundersta​nding\n(13:33:55) Perm'd_bitch: Ungrateful\n(13:33:57)
