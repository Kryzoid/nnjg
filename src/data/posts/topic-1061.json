The function keys (F#s at the top row) have specific functions, such as screen brightness, volume, wireless card on/off, etc. To actually press one of the buttons for the F# function, F1 for example when I want to pull up a menu in Gmod, I have to hold down Fn + F1 to get a regular F1 press or else it brings up a display monitor change menu. Is there any way to disable the functions of my F# keys so they act regular? I know I did a real bad job explaining so if you don't understand it and are reading this please let me know."},{"postId":10099,"topicId":1061,"posterId":101,"postTime":1288221000,"postText":"I have that too, it can really be annoying, as if I miss the FN key and I press F2 then itll shut off my internet, taking about 2 minutes for it to start back up again -_-"},{"postId":10137,"topicId":1061,"posterId":222,"postTime":1288279211,"postText":"Seems that you left it the way it came.. -.-\n\nSeems that a hotkey program is installed, just uninstall it..."},{"postId":10150,"topicId":1061,"posterId":153,"postTime":1288295681,"postText":"Tape down FN. lol"},{"postId":10170,"topicId":1061,"posterId":4,"postTime":1288304119,"postText":">> Ben\":3hczf57n]Tape down FN. lolâ€‰\nXD"}]}
