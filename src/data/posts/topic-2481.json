From what I recall, I saw you, considered banning you, and did. \n\nFrom what I remember, you rdmed a good 3+ times. And although you \"knew\" they had guns, you cant kill them just for that. Because all I saw was you run up to 2 guys and shoot them for no reason. You didnt even explain yourself.\n\nBan's lowered to 2 weeks."}]}
