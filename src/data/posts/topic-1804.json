I say \"what fruity loops?\" and then he goes on \"yea well it's not fruity loops anymore it's FL studio they want to sound more professional\"\n\nme - ok ok, yea cool I have that\nhim - really?\nme - yea pirated it good shit\nhim - oh... You pirated it?\nme - you didn't? How'd you get it\nhim - I paid 3 $100 increments over my summer and I also got the FL studio bible that's a 400 page book\nme - yea there's a pdf of the bible, didn't bother getting it, why waste all that time? It's like 2 mins to pirate it shit goes fast\nhim - *Gets very loud on purpose to try to draw attention from people around me* I can't believe you would brag about pirating something! Do you know how hard those people work! FL Studio is made by 1 guy it's very impressive he deserves money\nme - well... Yea it's a tool... So if you're gonna make more then $300 with it then go ahead and buy it I just mess around\nhim - I don't really make money with it, I do it for the joy\nme - Erm... So you waited the entire summer paying increments until you got it? Seriously 2 mins\n\nthen we get distracted and continue our lab\n\nwhat a dumbass trololol'd irl\n\n\nand without further ado, go get yourselves some FL studio for free and shove it in this bastards face >;)\n\n-- No --\n\nnah you don't needa I'm just doin that for kicks tell me what you think, am I a bastard for pirating when I don't plan to use it seriously or is he a dumbfuck? Thanks"}]}
