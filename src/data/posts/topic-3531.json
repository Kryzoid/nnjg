I really like this server and I feel that i shouldn't have a perma ban and that its just a little crazy that i have a perma ban. Im not asking for a unban just like a month ban or 2 weeks."},{"postId":28216,"topicId":3531,"posterId":142,"postTime":1312841273,"postText":"Lowering down to 2 weeks, seeing it is your first offense but read the rules next time."}]}
