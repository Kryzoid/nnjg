Well, it was.\nI am not the guy who plays JailBreak a lot, but it was fun playing on your server and I thought I should register on the forums here.\n\nNow I've found out that you would have a PERP server, so I saw a reason for me to stay here since I like RP a lot.\nI hope that the server will get up in good standing, and of course with good administration team, and good players of course (And I wish the other servers to stay as active as they are)\n\n About Me \nI am from Denmark.\nI am 16 years old.\nI play Garry's Mod  a lot . (And Terraria)\nI like Serious RP (Garry's Mod)\nI like to build contraptions. (Garry's Mod)\nFavorite Movie: How to train your dragon.\nYou probably didn't even read ''About Me'' but I don't care, neither do you.\n\nBut again,  hello ."},{"postId":22943,"topicId":2859,"posterId":101,"postTime":1306689895,"postText":"Forums welcome to rules posting before the read please."},{"postId":22947,"topicId":2859,"posterId":243,"postTime":1306691809,"postText":">> Welcome to the forums, read the rules before posting please. \n(Fixed)\n\nAnd Yes.
