However, I know no one to play it with. I love it's fast paced combat and especially the fact that EVERYONE has an awesome jetpack to use. I love the class based combat that gives me fond memories of tf2 but with a more refined and polished feeling. I encourage everyone to buy this game even if you have to wait for a steam sale to get it."},{"postId":25774,"topicId":2285,"posterId":964,"postTime":1310940198,"postText":"I play it too and currently have no body to play it with since pirate bailed :).\nBut dont they have only one map, the dessert?\nOh and its FTP :P"},{"postId":25788,"topicId":2285,"posterId":634,"postTime":1310962674,"postText":"This is old.
