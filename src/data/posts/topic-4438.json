As you can see in the screenshots, he laughs at it and when I tell him he could be punished for it he responds he \"doesn't care\".\n\nStaff Members: NOPE\n\nProof: Sorry I didn't highlight, just pay attention to yellow text except in the first one, where  you should read Tal's last words too.\n\nThe conversation I had with him:\n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237015390/D46A3EF1EB1CB0DC27B865EBCECBCDB19C7DA7C4/ \n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237016175/CC6E02F3AFB18FEF6170927964E473C4094A9930/ \n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237016992/6278E921B7DDDCA041B81CB2FDF4C2B548D038D0/ \n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237017781/B7AFEF381A5A0CE8F273CF0ECEEBADE4A1873BE6/ \n\nAnd the after-round results, where you can see he was hit by a car, and Tal was shot by fellow innocent Jcorr, which could be karma/points trolling on Kefta's behalf:\n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237043097/0714C729C8198453C10814B9CE5BB9BAFF4CF99D/ \n http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/540655515237043977/5FA4E4F8F1CA454E83CC21B21F60246AD2FF9B87/ \n\nDunno if it's enough for a ban, but I remember this guy doing this kind of stuff before and frankly it's irritating and a form of trolling."},{"postId":35058,"topicId":4438,"posterId":812,"postTime":1318045850,"postText":"Banned for a week, locked."}]}
