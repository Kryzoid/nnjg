This was not a malicious rdm. At most these guys both deserve a day ban (at most). shots started flying as soon as you killed epic turtle because he did not actually shoot at anyone and you killed him for it and it was easy for the other innocents to just see it as you killing an innocent. I recall you rdming me a few rounds later because of some burning body I had no idea about. So it's obvious that people can make mistakes ( even you ) let's just drop this one because bottom line, these guys really don't deserve a ban."},{"postId":22320,"topicId":2774,"posterId":54,"postTime":1305866834,"postText":"Denied. \nInsignificant proof."}]}
