And then they moved all my classes\n\nI was in 3 AP classes and 2 advanced classes.\n\nThey replaced my APbio with earth science, but wait! They took my pre-calc, and moved me into geometry.\n\nThis is really angering me as I had a 3.5 GPA. I told the head-mistress(private school) that I did not like them, and she said that it is school policy that mentaly disabled people be moved down.\n\nThis is not going to look good on my collage resume, \nI filled a complaint to the counselor also.\n\n\nP.S. I will not be releasing any information regarding the school just yet :P I dont want to get in trouble.\n\n\nThis is not a troll thread, real replys only please."},{"postId":8727,"topicId":914,"posterId":101,"postTime":1286246334,"postText":"Sue their asses."},{"postId":8729,"topicId":914,"posterId":4,"postTime":1286246625,"postText":"Fucking stereotypes.\nI'm really sorry man, hopefully something can be arranged..."},{"postId":8735,"topicId":914,"posterId":48,"postTime":1286253484,"postText":"That's fucking dumb.\n\nYour GPA proves that you have the mental capabilities to complete those courses.\nHonestly, do everything you can to switch, and if they won't let you; transfer schools.\n\nAs much as not going to the same school with your friends anymore would suck,\nFuture > Present situation\nespecially with the lack of jobs right now\n:/\n\nBut yeah, that fucking sucks :C"},{"postId":8739,"topicId":914,"posterId":26,"postTime":1286286082,"postText":">> That's fucking dumb.\n\n Your GPA proves that you have the mental capabilities to complete those courses. \nHonestly, do everything you can to switch, and if they won't let you; transfer schools.\n\nAs much as not going to the same school with your friends anymore would suck,\nFuture > Present situation\nespecially with the lack of jobs right now\n:/\n\nBut yeah, that fucking sucks :C \n\n\nNot neccesarily, Im a A-Worthy student, I've been asked to go to all honors every year (Cept this year since there is no history-honors class), Declined every time and get a b-a average, because i could honestly give a shit about school\n\nAnd there is such thing as cheating, Not meaning you do, but just disproving that GPA proves mental capabilities."},{"postId":8743,"topicId":914,"posterId":3,"postTime":1286310363,"postText":"Drop out.
