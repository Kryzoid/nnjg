But wouldn't of known if it was error without Rain and a few others on list messaging me what's up and even a few called. Ty everyone for help and understanding. All that happened was they sent out phising links to people on list. Was lucky they didn't do more cause email was registered on account with same password as Steam account, and my card info was saved to Steam too :O. Pretty sure it is all good now *knock on wood*"},{"postId":2384,"topicId":221,"posterId":12,"postTime":1275961895,"postText":"Point is proven. Locked"}]}
