First one was ninjakirby who bought a jihad before he tried to rdm, and second time was Udane who bought a radar before he tried to rdm them. We started a vote kick but left immediately after it was started.\n\nA picture of the DMG logs are in my steam page: http://steamcommunity.com/id/hidden_assassin/screenshot/576668995810974666\n\nI also crowbarred Udane to make sure my suspicion of him traitor scripting was true. I did apologize and explain that to Udane at the time. (Less then 20 hp wouldn't let him do much as traitor sadly)"},{"postId":19502,"topicId":2450,"posterId":521,"postTime":1303619549,"postText":"Wats traitor scripting"},{"postId":19503,"topicId":2450,"posterId":54,"postTime":1303622497,"postText":"damn tator scripters... i hate em.\n\nban request accepted."}]}
