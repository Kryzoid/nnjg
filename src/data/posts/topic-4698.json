I was t, and figured I could get an easy kill seeing as neither was T and it would be chocked up to RDM on whoever I killed, and I'd be fine for taking out an RDMer. After I killed Jcorr tiny22tj shot me in the face. Later he claimed it to be DNA, yet he never took my DNA in the damagelogs. He also disrespected me, although the server crashed before I could screen it.  So, in essence, he was RDMing two people.\n5) Were any specific server rules broken:RDM, Player Disrespect\n6) Any staff members on the server at the time of the offence:None\n7) Proof:\nhttp://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/614966810932993275/C4AC0AD44151365A3A7F4FC763A33993C0C23A99/\nhttp://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/614966810932996868/B5177A4CDDA069A60340B918862C152BD8AD4D5E/"}]}
