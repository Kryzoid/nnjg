After you have bought all possible upgrades, hats, trails, ect., all that you can do is just accumulate points. My idea is that with those accumulated poitnts, you will unlock other things that are very unique, but do not require you to buy anything, so that they could have different ranks like 1000, 2000, and up.

I personally think it shouldn't be implemented because its ''4 teh lulz'' and usually those don't work very well for people new to jailbreak.\n\nMaybe iron sights should be added instead of the semi-auto when you press right click. \n\nCustom gun skins anyone?"},{"postId":30877,"topicId":3703,"posterId":801,"postTime":1314336452,"postText":"i say we lock this post, and actually put all of our suggestions, in the suggestions sub forum o.o?"},{"postId":30879,"topicId":3703,"posterId":735,"postTime":1314337364,"postText":"Add suggestions in the subforum.\nLocked"}]}
