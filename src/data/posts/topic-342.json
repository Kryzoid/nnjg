All known viruses that cause influenza in birds belong to the species influenza A virus. All subtypes (but not all strains of all subtypes) of influenza A virus are adapted to birds, which is why for many purposes avian flu virus is the influenza A virus (note that the \"A\" does not stand for \"avian\").\n\nAdaptation is non-exclusive. Being adapted towards a particular species does not preclude adaptations, or partial adaptations, towards infecting different species. In this way strains of influenza viruses are adapted to multiple species, though may be preferential towards a particular host. For example, viruses responsible for influenza pandemics are adapted to both humans and birds. Recent influenza research into the genes of the Spanish flu virus shows it to have genes adapted to both birds and humans; with more of its genes from birds than less deadly later pandemic strains. "},{"postId":3605,"topicId":342,"posterId":153,"postTime":1277391218,"postText":"Bird Flu is special."},{"postId":3616,"topicId":342,"posterId":55,"postTime":1277413309,"postText":"omfg nixon LOL xD"},{"postId":3630,"topicId":342,"posterId":39,"postTime":1277426817,"postText":"Bird Flu  is a pirate\nar har, fiddle di dee,\nBeing a pirate is alright to be,\nDo what you want â€˜cause a pirate is free,\nYou are a pirate!\nYou are a pirate!\nYay!\nWe've got us a map, (a map!)\nTo lead us to a hidden box,\nThat's all locked up with locks!
