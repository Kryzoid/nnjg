These will never be allowed. If anyone is confused about this, here is your answer. \nIt seems as though some people think it's okay to start shooting players when there's a map vote. It's not.\n\n(RDM: RDM is a term we use for randomly killing someone. It means Random Death Matching, people use it when they were killed without any evidence pointing to them and the killer went because they took a guess, or just decided to kill the person for no other reason.)"},{"postId":25141,"topicId":3160,"posterId":586,"postTime":1309640250,"postText":"Oh, thanks for the info, :P, I do this at end of rounds after the vote has ended and we are switching to it ATM.\n\nThanks again, and sorry :|."},{"postId":25150,"topicId":3160,"posterId":237,"postTime":1309647653,"postText":">> Oh, thanks for the info, :P, I do this at end of rounds after the vote has ended and we are switching to it ATM.\n\nThanks again, and sorry :|. \nYeah, xD i've never known that our post-game tradition was against the rules.

Just let him do it honestly, that would solve ALL the issues, it would even let people rtv during round instead of having to kick them which doesn't work anyway, and it will solve the issue with someone leaving that didn't vote and BAM theres the rtv popping up because of that 1 leaver."}]}
