One of the pics even shows him admitting to trolling. So if this isn't considered trolling then we need a really updated definition of what trolling is on the server. Anything done or said to try and make someone annoyed or mad is trolling. Since i cant take demo's i can't prove that he non-stopped followed me till 2 warnings round after round as well so i didn't mention it. I still am asking for a ban or some form of punishment since this has been going on for 3 maps.\n\nEDIT: http://steamcommunity.com/id/hidden_assassin/screenshot/576674944640002765?tab=public\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/hidden_assassin/screenshot/576674944640146577?tab=public\n\nAgain, after getting kicked and warned to stop."},{"postId":24877,"topicId":3115,"posterId":272,"postTime":1309136981,"postText":"Still though, I don't think that it warrants such an extensive punishment.
