Cake and I worked an agreement for me to get permed on there. I didn't just want a \"Gash perm me\" type of thing. I wanted to be permed. But then Ben extends it to ALL servers. I didn't do anything on all of the servers, only ttt did I break the rules. And I got punished for it, didn't I? But the perm on all servers is just dumb. I'd like to be in NNJG still, I'd like to hang with NNJG still, the perm on all servers is just ridiculous in my opinion. And plus, Ben only banned me due to him and Cake being cool. I'm friends with Cake again. He only wanted me banned from the TTT, which I got banned on it. The perm on all servers just made it dumb. I didn't do ANYTHING on any of the other servers. Only TTT have I done something wrong."},{"postId":5847,"topicId":650,"posterId":4,"postTime":1282324074,"postText":"i think/say second chance."},{"postId":5853,"topicId":650,"posterId":47,"postTime":1282329027,"postText":"I say no.

Gash saw how I just asked him \"gash unban me, gash ban me\" and a ban that cannot be undone is what Cake wanted. So I did it, I made it so I couldn't be on TTT again, then I saw other servers on NNJG, and I wanted to play them. And I saw I was globally banned, and it was pretty unreasonable.
