This game has to be extrememly laid back, and anyone who would DDoS a gmod server is just trying to get attention, or just doesn't like it when he sucks at the game so has to attempt to ruin it for everyone else. Then, at the failed DDoS by a 9 year old kid, he probably rages even more and gets a video of him put up on youtube of him shoving a remote up his ass."},{"postId":36528,"topicId":4608,"posterId":2,"postTime":1319745657,"postText":">> Vasto found out who it was an banned the guy.

Yes.\nWould anyone REALLY consider it ethnocentric? Probably Not."}]}
