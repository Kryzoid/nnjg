It can be dropped, but once dropped it is removed. So, it's not that overpowered against a knife...

Then I spun around and killed the other one, who was also a traitor, before he could even shoot. So it is definitely overpowered against a knife."},{"postId":5842,"topicId":647,"posterId":112,"postTime":1282316134,"postText":"A delay really needs to be added. It reloads in a second flat :/"}]}
