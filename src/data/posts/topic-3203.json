Now that we are all up to speed, for the details. The tournament will consist of one week of sign up period, starting immediately.\nTo sign up, please post in this thread specifying that you want to participate. A list of currently signed-up members is at the bottom of this thread.\nAfter that, we will arrange signed up members into a tournament tree, which will be edited into this post. Next upon the tournament tree being\nreleased, you will need to get in touch with your first opponent and arrange a time and date to spleef within the next three days of when the tree was released.\nTHEN SPLEEF WILL HAPPEN (at you and your opponent(s)) agreed-upon time/date). Keep in mind you must communicate your time/date of battle to kryzoid, tinfoilhatter, or myself. \nOne of us will be your witness to keep track and update the tree. This will continue and repeat until there is one epic person standing on top of all the sorry losers who just didn't get to win.\n\nREMEMBER: MATCHES CANNOT HAPPEN AND BE RECORDED OFFICIALLY UNLESS WITNESSED BY ME, KRYZOID, TINFOILHATTER, KROWKROWKROW, OR KOAC.\n\n July 8~15 - Sign-ups \n July 15 - Release of Tournament Tree in this post. \n July 15~20 - Arrangements/battles round 1. \n July 20~23 - Arrangements/battles round 2 \n  July 23~28 - Arrangements/battles round 3 (grand finale)  \n\nPRIZE: Tournament winner will receive one *anything* on steam priced at $4.99 or under  and 64 gold ingots in-game. Second place will receive 32 gold ingots in-game.\n\nNOTE: We would also like one really active member to video-record in high quality most if not all matches, and everyone is free to spectate ongoing matches.\n\n http://min.us/ibSLUc.png \n\n ***Upon unanimous request, we can do up to two do-overs/rematches per group.\n**** Spleef matches will be in the official spleef arena of Central City using four layers (or more if unanimously requested).\n***** If we can't contact an opponent for any reason before the three days of the round are up, their position will be forfeited and they will lose by default. "},{"postId":25450,"topicId":3203,"posterId":243,"postTime":1310143291,"postText":"OH OH, PICK ME!\nI would like to participate.\nAnd btw, will the 1.7.3 be added to the server, due to the \"duplicate items bug\" being fixed?
