The bans they get are coming, and they are just making it easier for us to get rid of people who would cause future issues."},{"postId":36611,"topicId":4664,"posterId":1016,"postTime":1319779889,"postText":"Nah, shop hasn't improved for me, I was able to use it for some time, gladly I was able to get all the gravity upgrades and a decent outfit."}]}
