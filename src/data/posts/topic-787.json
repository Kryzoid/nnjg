He said he thought I was in the traitor menu, which is in my opinion a bull shit reason. I have very few evidence, but its the best i could provide. It's a chatlog. I figured I'd take a screenshot instead of copy and pasting the actual thing.\n http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/8559/evidenceh.png \n\n\nAlso in a way he was killing an AFK, as I was unable to control as I was eatting. Which is rule breaking. I hope that he can be punished in some way.\n\n- [NNJG] Shin Chan."},{"postId":7276,"topicId":787,"posterId":4,"postTime":1284077532,"postText":"Well, it was only one kill. If the person only killed you once, i recommend trying to calm down and just getting over it.\nBut since he did break a rule or two, in my opinion i would say 2 day ban but that's just me."},{"postId":7278,"topicId":787,"posterId":242,"postTime":1284077608,"postText":"Doh!
