I died and went afk then when i came back I saw him alive o.o....\n\nor\n\nIf there is no command to revive people or w/e from what we have. There can be 1 other possibility apart him from hacking.\nIn his Kicking Hackers addon, he added some of his own special commands to allow him to do extra stuff or something! RAWR!!!
