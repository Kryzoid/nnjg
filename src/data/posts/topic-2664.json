(Letting certain prisoners have weapons/more rights unless its their LR)\nNo giving Last requests involving Rdm. (ex. Asking your entire team to be killed last round.)\nNo kills days. (ex. Everybody gets into the airlock or gets shot)\nNo impossible orders. (ex. No moving, No touching the ground)\nYou cannot kill somebody for having a weapon they can't drop.\nYou cannot tell somebody to put away their fists.\nDo NOT kill the last person before giving them a last request, unless they don't get one. They lose it by\n-Being disguised while another prisoner is giving the LR\n-Attacking the guards instead of giving it.\nNo loopholes(Example: Okay guards, let's have a friendly guard shooting day)\nTreat disguised guards as actual guards until they make themselves known(ex. Shooting a guard.)\n\nIf you disrespect an admin, they get to choose your punishment.\nIf you say the server sucks, you will be permanently banned and not missed.\nIf you freetranq, I will get really pissed.\nIf you exploit/hack, you will be permanently banned.\nIf you are racist, you will be permanently banned.\nGive specific rules: Don't leave the prisoners confused. (ex. If you are playing simon says and want the prisoners to jump more than once, don't just say \"jump\" and kill them when they don't do it anymore)\n\nYou must open cells.\nIf a LR includes killing a guard it can only be one. ( Not the whole team)\n\nNo freedays/zombie freedays\nNo armory camping. As guards your job is to make sure the prisoners follow orders. Not hide in a corner hoping they don't find you.\n\n\n And about the age limit. \n  There is no age limit and there never will be. If you don't like it you can leave. Don't complain.  \n\nCredits to your fellow NNJG admin team. :3"},{"postId":21378,"topicId":2664,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304989512,"postText":"List banned games?\n\nZombie freeday, warday, freeday, opininated games, etc\n\nNice guide, this should be the motd"},{"postId":21380,"topicId":2664,"posterId":2,"postTime":1304989596,"postText":"75% of our community just learned that Jail isn't Team Deathmatch."},{"postId":21387,"topicId":2664,"posterId":595,"postTime":1304990513,"postText":"Gash I love you, and Farrow, please do add banned game, whenever I get on I have to say, \" no  (insertwardennamehere) whats for dinner/freedays/warday/exuction day is not allowed.
