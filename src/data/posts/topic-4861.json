I didn't see it happen but I believe him because they were both in the same clan or whatever the tag is for. Luna was also RDMing, disrespecting players, trolling, and mic spamming. Epic Squirral also RDMed a few times. SPAI was also mic spamming quite alot in peaches castle.\n5) Were any specific server rules broken: RDM, Player Disrespect, Trolling, Mic Spam.\n6) Any staff members on the server at the time of the offence: None\n7) Proof:\n http://i43.tinypic.com/10q9wsz.jpg \n http://i41.tinypic.com/4kd0nn.png \n http://i44.tinypic.com/2ylsjty.png \n http://i43.tinypic.com/2mm5o5h.png "},{"postId":37630,"topicId":4861,"posterId":798,"postTime":1320963299,"postText":"I have some evidence for spai RDMing 3 people, he also is RDMing currently, will post when round is over.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032454327/screenshot/632982493455211767?tab=public\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032454327/screenshot/632982493455211012/?tab=public\n(edit) http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032454327/screenshot/632982493455274867"},{"postId":37632,"topicId":4861,"posterId":812,"postTime":1320963470,"postText":"[AHG] Luna, and [AHG] Zurchi have both been banned.

Though seeing as he's console banned, I'll have to wait for that to expire to add his new ban."}]}
