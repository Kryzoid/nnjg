Pirates will never die, and your ship is already sinking. You took an important part of us on this day, but that is just it, a small part. Our network still stands and there are many more places for us. As long as we have those willing to fight and help each other for the good of free sharing, we will never fall. Keep on fighting."},{"postId":10117,"topicId":1064,"posterId":2,"postTime":1288234126,"postText":"Warez/Pirating is not allowed. 1d ban.\nBut you're Sanya so it's a 1 hour ban. :)"}]}
