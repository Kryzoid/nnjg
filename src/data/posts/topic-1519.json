And I can do nothing about it.  Yes, I can report each one individualy, but that would take forever to get proof of even just one person.  What I want is a more streamline process, maybe a command that submits a player to the server, and then if enough people report them, an admin will later look at it and get that person banned or whatever is appropriate.  This would make it more possible to get people punished.  I know there may be problems with this idea, but I can't stand not being able to do anything."},{"postId":13476,"topicId":1519,"posterId":426,"postTime":1294008259,"postText":"God that would be so helpful"},{"postId":13535,"topicId":1519,"posterId":39,"postTime":1294092551,"postText":"I'm usually on watching things, but I think this would be great considering I have midterms coming up, and I assume some of the other jailmins will also be preoccupied with this."},{"postId":13538,"topicId":1519,"posterId":54,"postTime":1294095954,"postText":">> I'm usually on watching things, but I think this would be great considering I have midterms coming up, and I assume some of the other jailmins will also be preoccupied with this. \nI'm on at times\nOff topic: I thought you got denied for mod o.O (not trying to be rude)"},{"postId":13544,"topicId":1519,"posterId":39,"postTime":1294098174,"postText":"Funny Story\nI was mod when I applied\nI just didn't know it :/"},{"postId":13555,"topicId":1519,"posterId":372,"postTime":1294115386,"postText":"Since so many people like this idea, maybe it could actually happen.
