I played the leaked beta of the second, and it turned me off so much I haven't bought it."},{"postId":36692,"topicId":4687,"posterId":82,"postTime":1319954091,"postText":"Crysis 2 doesn't need to be modifiable, the whole CryEngine 3 SDK is available for free, (I think) it comes with all the Crysis 2 assets. \n\nI like Crysis's gameplay a whole lot better than the original, a lot less sandboxy but the levels still branched off with different options to suit different playstyles. That, and the AI is a lot better as well."}]}
