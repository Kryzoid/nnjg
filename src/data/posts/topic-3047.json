(it's time for round two. Round isn't translated.)\n\nNow, you might not know que yo hablo about. http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=112441 That might ring a bell. You also might remember that it was a complete disaster. Like, big. Laggy server, bad coordination, people weren't cooperating and we pissed off gash (don't do that. Hi gashie).\n\nhttp://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=122082\n\nAlright, now obviously we don't want a shitton of people doing this.\n\nSo my plan:\n\n-Close off flood for one night, set to about 7 slots\n-Have sign ups (Kry, Punked, Gash and I may auto-join if we want. We were all there last time except Gash [Maybe, I knew we didn't tell him but I forgot if we actually let him join us [[Sorry for that again :(]]]) for everyone\n-Set DATE and TIME\n\nRequirements:\n-GMod (WELL NO SHIT)\n-EP1\n-EP2\n-Preferably a mic (Excluding Gash.
