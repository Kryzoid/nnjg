I think Dum was on that server too.\nI was playing jailrp I think cause nnjg was the only jailrp server I could find, and imagine my surprise when some people from thx, notably dumb, joined the server. I didn't really recognize them, but having people with mics on jailbreak/jailrp who are not 9 years old and know how to play is always a huge relief.\nThat's pretty much it I can do lots of stuff like map/lua but i suck at both but i can do them at least.\nI'm pretty pissed jailrp is unpopulated jail is my favorite game mode probably in garry's mod.\n\nKeep up the good servers...\nCrazy, or as others might know me Jo samma (steam [nnjg] Crazy [Jo samma])\nc ya\nBye\nK\nI'm done now really\nNo I'm not\nStill typing\nK\n...\nI don't know what to type\nI really need a signature\nRant\nRant\nRant\nHurray\nBye"}]}
