Then a couple of rounds later he kills Treecko, while Treecko is AFK, and says over mic that \"Treecko was suspicious, I thought he was buying a knife so I killed him\". We all told him that Treecko was obviously AFK and that he should slay himself. After he refused to slay himself, he also randomly shot Treecko during that round also.\nAdmins on?:Dum was there for when he killed Lenny, and slayed him.\nProof?:\n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/jesus1a.jpg \n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/jesus2a.jpg \n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/jesus3a.jpg \n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/Jesus5.jpg \n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/Jesus7.jpg \n http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t245/kennyd3333/Jesus6.jpg \n\nThat last log is proof of him not slaying himself."},{"postId":33271,"topicId":4160,"posterId":101,"postTime":1316035129,"postText":"Please don't include proof if an admin took care of it.
