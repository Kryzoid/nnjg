Ive played with him about all day and we had no problems.\nI had followed all the rules and didnt teamkill no one.\nBut ive killed him sence i was a traitor and he said i wasnt and got pissed.\nSo he decided to ban me for 3 days.\n\nI do not respect this admin at all he is horrible at the game himself and had teamkilled someone earlier today. I dont think he shall work for NNJG cause he is acting noobish and bans with hes own rules.\n\nHeres little info of my banned account:\nName: MartinOwnageBoy\nSteam id: STEAM_0:0:39510090\nBan date: 08-21-11 03:27 - Ban experies: 08-24-11 05:27\nBanned by: Balenti\nLenght: 3 d, 2 hr\n\nOf obvious reasons i DO NOT think he has any clue of what he is doing acting like a 5 year old.\nPlease contact me via:\nMsn: REDACTED@REDACTED\nSkype: teamjohannessen\n\nPlease unban me.\n\n__________________________________________________\nBtw: Of other admins ive started with Gmod for few days ago\nBut ive learned all the rules good now, in earlier time (2-3 days ago.) i didnt know them :).\n\nAnd if i hurt anyone i am sorry, i dont know why but ive heard things.. lol."},{"postId":30304,"topicId":3724,"posterId":373,"postTime":1313965871,"postText":"You were banned for crowbarring an AFK to death, throwing incens into a crowd of people and denying it.
