I am just wondering why i was banned. Today while playing TTT server i was a detective. I spawned a health station and said that only confirmed innocents could use it. Someone tried to use the health station and i warned them to stop or I would kill them. They backed away. About 30 seconds later the same guy tried to use it again and i killed him. \n\nWhat did i do wrong?\n\ningame name: Ryancarson025\nSteam name RyanCL25 \n\nPS: i know this is not the correct format, I don't care to be unbanned because its only a 1day ban"},{"postId":24497,"topicId":3077,"posterId":605,"postTime":1308603536,"postText":"Rdm, it was not the first time I've seen you do it in my time on the server\nIn this specific case, you dropped a dna scanner and tried to get someone to pick it up, then killed them.\nI've seen some problems rarely here n there before, so I went with a short ban.\nI was just slow with the ban, that kill you mention was legit.\n\nEdit* btw, if anyone recieves a ban by me, feel free to add me, im willing to talk about it."}]}
