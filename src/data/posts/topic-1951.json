A stone slab barrier and a waterfall was even added over the very front of my house which flooded my entrance.\n\nI left signs all over the place, but I figured I'd post it here as well. PLEASE STOP BUILDING ON OR NEAR MY HOUSE. \n\nI can tell you like waterfalls and random building all over the place, but please... leave what Zux and I built together alone.\n\nThank you\n-Don"},{"postId":16183,"topicId":1951,"posterId":4,"postTime":1298222028,"postText":"I'll start keeping an eye out.
