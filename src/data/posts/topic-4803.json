Although i do realise there is a problem with blocking the trap on the basement stairs, i could assuem that we could just have Udane easly remove this?!\n\nAlso Minecraft was my favorte map on this server, untill it was removed. It was bright, colorful and made my day. It was also lots of fun becuase the small map made you think of ways to kill. I.E: In the T tester basement, spray everyone down tehre with Huge, then break glass , jump down and move to land in water next to rock. Instant win and great escape with people are up top if your fast enough.\n\nI really do miss both of these maps, but the one i want to see backt the most is Minecraft!"},{"postId":37246,"topicId":4803,"posterId":2,"postTime":1320555087,"postText":"There should also be a \"neither\" option...
