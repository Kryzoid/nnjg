To start off (because I'm sure this will be the first question for many of you) I will still be doing the giveaway. You'll still be able to catch me on Steam [Dick Nixon], World of Failcraft [REDACTED@REDACTED], XBOX Live [Jedi Nixon], and coming soon the PlayStation Network. Ben, I still really don't like you all that much, you're changing too much shit for too many non-existent reasons. Gash, you're cool but you're too hidden in the shadows and not doing enough of anything for my taste. Bird, you're still the fucking man. Mak, Dark, and Deth, you're the only Canadians I wouldn't slaughter IRL. Kryzoid, good luck keeping the kiddies in line. Bewm, good times in flood. Bearcats, I still want to know what the hell that weapon was gonna be. \n\nAnd without further adieu, I leave you with the greatest pic I ever did seed:\n http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/1430/vxgs9v.png "},{"postId":12060,"topicId":1329,"posterId":142,"postTime":1292642238,"postText":"All I can say is....   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  "},{"postId":12066,"topicId":1329,"posterId":101,"postTime":1292646843,"postText":"You dick :("},{"postId":12067,"topicId":1329,"posterId":82,"postTime":1292647687,"postText":"I am sad to see you leave.
