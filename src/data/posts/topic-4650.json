Then they left as usual. Etrius asked anyone if they had his steam id. Someone sent entrius, etrius's steam id. Later after Several minutes he realised this. Then he wanted to ban the person that had sent him his own steam id. He was not sure who it was and just picked me.\n\n6) Who banned you: Etrius\n\n7) Why should we unban you or shorten your ban period: I have never shown admin/vip disrespect, i was banned unjust and without evidence, and if i didnt actually care about playing the jailbreak server correctly, i wouldnt previosuly posted something trying to get turf wars banned."},{"postId":36351,"topicId":4650,"posterId":481,"postTime":1319582404,"postText":"Unbanned.
