I know for a fact that people kill other innocents for a rocket jump just because they want it so bad, also it causes problems because traitors either pick it up from a fellow traitors body, or fake picking it up from a dead traitors body and buy it after they ID said body. And are killed for this directly after.\n\nTLDR - Rocket Jump causes problems for innocents, disallow innocent pickup (like traitor sniper)"},{"postId":28064,"topicId":3510,"posterId":79,"postTime":1312736540,"postText":"If a inno has a rocket jump then there better be a dead traitor. Also he should be the one who killed said traitor. Its like this for knives and everything else. Someone sees a inno running around with a knife. If their is no dead traitor OR if person with said knife isn't confirmed, then can be killed on sight for running around with it out. It doesn't matter if you say, \"I found a knife\". If your not confirmed running around with a T weapon out, you can be killed"},{"postId":28382,"topicId":3510,"posterId":612,"postTime":1312951079,"postText":"crisis, planting traitor weapons is a legit strategy for traitors\ni do it alot\nand i get 7-8 kills too\n\ninno:\"OMG I FOUND A RJ\"\nme as T\"LIES\" kill kill kill"}]}
