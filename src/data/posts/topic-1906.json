I was wondering if there is any way to fix it? It's not anything to do on his part either\ncrocoshet :D: did he open a support ticket yet?\nMark: I'm not sure, I'll ask him\nMark: Mr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: I've done it a couple times, they don't know what causes the lag. It was fine on the other IP, this one.. not so much. It's not that bad, but it's annoying to hear people complain constantly.\n-- The lag is terrible though.\ncrocoshet :D: I don't think anyone would say we don't know..\ncrocoshet :D: tell him to reply to his tickets if they were closed\nMark: on a side note, happy Valentine's Day to you too.\ncrocoshet :D: haha\nMark: Mr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: Just reply to one?\nMr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: xD\nMark: Yes\nMr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: Brock was actually the one replying in the ticket.\nMr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: :l\nMr. Gash ⊰ [NNJG] ⊱: Tyler was the first one, then it changed to MIchael, and the last one was saying to change the tickrate to 33, which did nothing, and it was Brock saying it.\ncrocoshet :D is now playing Counter-Strike: Source. Click here to join.\ncrocoshet :D: just reply and say its still lagging\nMark: He says the tickets are closed.\ncrocoshet :D: they close if no one replies after a day, reply to open\nMark: oh, he sent a reply\ncrocoshet :D: ok\nMark: thanks brock :D  croc is the owner of Xenon servers. I told him about it, so hopefully he'll fix it! :D \nLocked again, will unlock when Brock updates Gash or myself."}]}
