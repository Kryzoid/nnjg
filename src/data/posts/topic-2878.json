The way we're doing it is pretty much underselling our vip (when comparing it to other popular communities) and that is hurting us to the point where we struggle to re-buy our servers. This new format of pricing would be effective and surely keep us up and running month after month.\n\n\nCurrent way donations work:\nJail: Pay $3 once, permenant vip*\nTTT: Pay $5 once, permenant  vip*\n\nSuggested prices:\nJail: Pay $5 once a month, if not paid, it is automatically revoked**\nTTT: Pay $5 once a month, if not paid, it is automatically revoked**\nPERP: Pay $5 once a month, if not paid, it is automatically revoked**\n\n\n*Unless abused\n** PERP coder Storm has already created an automatic system where vip expires at the end of the 30 day vip they pay for. It's simple, and I'm sure he can implement it into all other servers as well.\n\nSurely the players who pay for vip will be upset, and I'm sure some would refuse to buy vip. But, over time, the monthly payments of the vips we regain and gain would make up for those losses. For example, vip #1 refuses to pay the montly payment. But vip #2 decides to pay for this new monthly payment. After 2 months, we have made up for that loss.\n\nI want to hear feedback from you all on this. Criticism and agreements alike are welcome."},{"postId":23081,"topicId":2878,"posterId":4,"postTime":1306881055,"postText":"I completely agree, but the price of Jail should be raised to $5."},{"postId":23087,"topicId":2878,"posterId":115,"postTime":1306882314,"postText":"Yeah, I was going to type that.
