No I meant it Rain, I thought I remembered hearing you were literate in teh graphic art. I know Kry is the best but I already owe him, and Gash is too but motivating him to do stuff is big. I don't know anyone else that does it, prob because they don't want to cause they know everyone will ask them for stuff XD. I just want someone to do me a solid and get me the basics, signature and spray.
