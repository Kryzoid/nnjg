In total he probably rdmed over 10 people. No admins on. I was the only one with the NNJG tag on and I tried to get Pharaoh on who might have been playing PERP, and Gash who was playing MW2.\n\nWitnesses: \ndx5231 \ncartmin45\nMr. Bigglesworth\nMoloc\nDr. Garbonzo \nI_SEE_YOU2™\npilotp94\nSweet Wolf\nSuicide Bagel\nRasey\nYour Mother   ---yes that's his username\nSarver \nBLAH\n[NBLCKK] Ctrl Alt Defeat NBLCKK\n\nBut here is the link to the videos. In this video the two people he killed may be hard to see but they are visible.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FNug3jpPqg\n\n\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to look at this ban request. Trust me that all the witnesses do not want this guy to come back on our TTT server."},{"postId":9906,"topicId":1035,"posterId":2,"postTime":1287981013,"postText":"I wish there were ratings.
