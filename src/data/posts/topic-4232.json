Udane is on during the night, and now Playerhata should be able to handle most ban requests. We still need to finish some of the apps, personally I suggest we promote Moonrakerone, and possibly Destar or NutterButter.\n\n Also, Ben, you need to set up Playerhata's forum access. "},{"postId":33707,"topicId":4232,"posterId":4,"postTime":1316467864,"postText":"I think that the remaining applications should be handled first so that the 3 who resigned can be replaced by Playerhata and hopefully 2 others.\nAnd Kush should be demoted."}]}
