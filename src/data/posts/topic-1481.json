The slaps and slays are supposed to tell you to STOP what you are doing, it means you were in the wrong. Did you? Guess not since that leads me to the forth thing. You killed 4 people because you got pissed. You should have stopped when the admin Dum slapped or slayed you. You obviously didn't get the point.\n\nLocked and denied. You knew what you did was wrong, but you kept up. An admin warned you, but you just got mad and did it more.\n\n(Dum, you can unlock this and input what you have to say if you'd like, but for now, locked.)"},{"postId":13302,"topicId":1481,"posterId":153,"postTime":1293836381,"postText":"I'm unlocking this because I'm not sure I understand the entire story.\nA permaban seems very excessive in this case, and Dum doesn't even remember why he banned you.\nDum, slapping for 90 damage is not a punishment.\nSlay->Kick->Ban should be the order of punishment.\nI'm leaning toward a ban length limit, instead of a permanent."},{"postId":13303,"topicId":1481,"posterId":101,"postTime":1293836792,"postText":"I don't remember slapping him at all.
