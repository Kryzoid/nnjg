But its bullshit because those props don't float. He prop surfs to get up there before the round starts, and cant lose because of how much damage it takes to kill him. Each of the props has 2k health and he has about 8 of them.\nThere is no way in hell you can be underwater long enough to destroy even one of the \"supports\" And you dont have enough time to destroy all of them up top.\nWere there any admins on at the time?:Yes, Dum and Quack\nProof:\nHis base: \nhttp://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/fm_wewks0005.jpg\nThe floor props:\nhttp://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/fm_wewks0006.jpg\nhttp://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/fm_wewks0007.jpg\nhttp://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/fm_wewks0008.jpg\nHim there before the round starts:\nhttp://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e285/umean123/fm_wewks0009.jpg"},{"postId":6079,"topicId":678,"posterId":3,"postTime":1282691337,"postText":"Bannable-no, kickable/slayable-yes."},{"postId":6084,"topicId":678,"posterId":101,"postTime":1282695725,"postText":">> Bannable-no, kickable/slayable-yes.â€‰\n\n\nGood, because I DID kick him for that then he went apeshit on me.
