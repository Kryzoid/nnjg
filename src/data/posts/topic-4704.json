I mean i woke up the next morning ready to play my Saturday morning and it says \"Sorry you've been banned\". Yeah kinda screwed up my morning:P Haha so im hoping i get a reply to this soon that way i can play tonight.

The constant rtving only added to the ban time.\nYou were told the first time you were kicked that it was rule 7, while the morons kept yelling rule 34. You still choose to rtv after we explained to read the !motd, and the rule itself."}]}
