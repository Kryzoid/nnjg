Once it's touched with the ammo, it'll use it. Of course the sight would never have been unlimited, and I think a half second warmup time is needed. Remember, one shotgun blast can deal well over 50 damage. If this only has 50 HP, it shouldn't take that long to shoot.\n\n Edit: \nAnd about the ammo, this means it should use the same speed as the weapon. Meaning it deals the same damage as mac10s do if it uses SMG ammo, and the same for pistol.
