I frequently play on this server and I began playing about a month ago. Last night, my friend had to stay over for the night and I introduced him to the game. He played a bit and then I went off to bed. He continued to play and when morning came he left. I went to play on the server and it said I was banned. I have no idea what he did and this is not a lame excuse to get unbanned. Please, unban me. I am sorry for my friends stupidity for whatever he had done to get me banned. My ingame name is MurielBagge. Thank you in advance and I am very sorry.\n-MurielBagge"},{"postId":19521,"topicId":2453,"posterId":112,"postTime":1303672994,"postText":"Follow the format and repost in the right section.\nYou were banned for repeated racism."}]}
