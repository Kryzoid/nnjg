Not even for VIP or Mod. Straight up serious donations. I also have a guy working on a map with me. Its going to be a pentagon (Like Five on CoD:BO) but point is, RP played right can be AMAZING. I have played on some good ones, good admins = good server. I would actualy love an RP but im fine with Deathmatch too."},{"postId":20815,"topicId":2576,"posterId":521,"postTime":1304553531,"postText":"You mean deathrun?\n\nDeathrun would get amazing amounts of VIPs.

I want to help the community by donating a server. And I like both. So whatever this vote turns out to be, and if Ben is alright with it.
