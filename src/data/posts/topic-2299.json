The detective weapon list is kind of shitty. So here are a few ideas. Keep in mind, that i cant make/ alter / create weapons. These are just ideas\n\n1. Proven innocent list.  \n(weapon shop)\n        Detective spends 1 credit for an item that gives him a list of people who have killed traitors. ( maybe controversial because of traitor teamkill, or rdm) \n\n2. Ugraded visualizer. \n( points store)-1000 PTS\n         Gives the detective a 5-7 sec clip of what happened or how the showdown was initiated. Shows which way some one went?\n\n3. Camouflage. \n (weapons shop)\n        Detective spends 1 credit on a weapon that will help him blend in with surroundings. (like a low powered cloaker, whilst holding ofcourse) \n\n4. Speed. \n(Weapon shop)\n     1 credit. Increase speed by 20 percent. \n\n5. Lasthuman alert. \n(Undecided)\n    Alerts detective only of last human. \n\n6. Credit faker. \n(weapons shop) \n 1credit. Kind of like a flare gun. Detective plants a \"search body to receive unspent credits!\" decoy on and dead body. Unsure about what happens if traitors search the bodies. Maybe a message alerts detective?. Body explodes for 50 DMG? Traitor catches fire? And is burned for 10 seconds.\n\n\nEDIT. \n7. For traitors. \nGrenades. Look like discombobs. Act like discombobs. Except longer timer on them. And explode for a predefined amount of damage. Still pushes maybe? Set of three. \n\n8. Gloop. \n Invisible. Sprayed/set on floor. Slows players for 20-30 seconds. Works on up to 5 players. \n\n9. Dna dummy. \n Takes 10 seconds to apply. When detective scans for dna its a false reading. 10 seconds to apply it. ( progression bar) 10 more seconds to take effect. \n\n10. Fake rag doll. \nDrops a rag doll that says \"Unidentified body\" could be used to ambush people. Corpse explodes? \n\n\nGive me some feed back. Like/ dislike? Improvements? \nThanks"},{"postId":18427,"topicId":2299,"posterId":112,"postTime":1301901027,"postText":"You do know that in the tab menu you can click the persons name and mark them as kill, suspect, missing, or friend?\n\nI'm iffy about the fake bodies, people would not I'd bodies and cause alot of rdm.\n\nI do like the advanced visualizer, but I dont know if it's possible to do that."},{"postId":18432,"topicId":2299,"posterId":389,"postTime":1301930048,"postText":"Apart from what Pharoah has already said.\n\n4. Are you talking about movement speed? firing rate? Please specify.\n\n5. Might as well have a radar?\n\n7. I swear at one time we had grenades that exploded and did damage.... but i guess not :S\n\n8. Hmmm Gloop, sounds decent, somewhat useful?\n\n9. 10. I dont know.. the ragdoll is gonna cause alot of rdm in my opinion.

Meh, doesn't seem like a point. I mean I guess that seems good.\n2. That (I think) would be mega-hard to code.\n3. Why not just get a damn cloaker?\n4. Would seem better if smaller and was a buy menu.\n5. Yeah, sure, why not. A bit pointless if you ask me, just buy a radar."},{"postId":18440,"topicId":2299,"posterId":292,"postTime":1301957751,"postText":"1. This is alright, could be useful.\n\n2. Would be cool if it were even remotely possible.\n\n3. Seems a bit useless. What would a detective have to hide for?\n\n4. Sure. I always wanted a sort of sprint tool, for traitor/detective. I think it's a good idea to put it on detective.\n\n5. Sure. Since it's so situational, put it on the credit shop.\n\n6. I like this idea. In my opinion it should simply leave a DNA mark.\n\n7. Seems useless. Could cause RDM for people throwing discombobs.\n\n8. Nah.\n\n9. Sure, why not? Again, its one of those situational things. But it could work.\n\n10. Like said by others, causes RDM."},{"postId":18441,"topicId":2299,"posterId":377,"postTime":1301963192,"postText":"1  TEAM KILL MAGNET, but otherwise a good Idea\n2. YES YES YES\n\n3.

I guess it is really similar to DNA scanner but this way seems more fun and you don't have to wait for a scan. Maybe there could be a limit so that after the killer goes a certain distance the path fades out."}]}
