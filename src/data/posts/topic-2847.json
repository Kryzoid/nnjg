You don't want to make the money extremely common, but at the same time you don't want it to be impossible to find.\nI don't think trades should go farther than anything in minecraft. It doesn't make sense to pay people in points on gmod for items in minecraft."},{"postId":22873,"topicId":2847,"posterId":4,"postTime":1306522684,"postText":">> -Make the armory in the miscellaneous shop open. \nIt's being worked on.\n>> -Make the block shop more open (Instead of only trading it planks, cobblestone, and dirt for gold, make it so you can also trade in other things such as gravel, etc.) \nActually, you can only trade in Cobblestone. Personally, i think it's fine as it is because not many people have large amounts of other resources such as gravel as much as cobblestone.\n>> -Make a sticky for trading. (Where you can do big trades or \"looking for\"s. Also you can do things such as \"______ for 25 TTT points.\" \nActually, that is a good idea. Though, maybe it should be it's own subforum.\n>> -Maybe more types of currency? Gets annoying using gold. Maybe slimeballs? (Trade in ____ for a slimeball! Trade in 1 slimeball for 64 wool!) \nYou're not really obligated to trade to others using gold, but we strongly advise it in order to establish a strong common mindset that our currency is the gold ingot. However, feel free to trade as you wish with other people, The shops/buildings in CC will always incorporate gold, though.\n>> -And make more items available for trade (Lapis Lupiz, maybe even a freaking WOOL shop. I'd love that.) \nWe don't want to sell valuables such as diamonds, at least not now. Also, regarding Lapis and a \"freaking WOOL shop,\" let me just say that the farmer's market and the armory aren't the only 2 things inside the Miscellaneous Store ;)\n\n   *EDIT*   \n>> It doesn't make sense to pay people in points on gmod for items in minecraft. \nThat doesn't stop people from paying IRL money for in-game items in Team Fortress 2.
