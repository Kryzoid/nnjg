Makes this very fun.\n\nMultiplayer is VERY buggy, And as you know. The game is in ALPHA. Notch is trying hard to fix most of the things, And he is most likely adding a server drop-down list later on after its fully fixed.\n\nAtleast notch didn't enable hp so you would die without being able to fight back to anything :|"},{"postId":10610,"topicId":1115,"posterId":101,"postTime":1288979447,"postText":"Exactly...
