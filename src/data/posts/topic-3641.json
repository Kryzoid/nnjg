Plus. That was really not the big of a deal. I didnt really start it either. I posted a ban request and simply defended myself. But I understand what you mean.\n\nEdit: what I meant by not fair is because every one makes a few mistakes. That one incident happened to involve me. I won't say I didn't have any fault. But it's not fair to say I'm immature because of one thing."},{"postId":29488,"topicId":3641,"posterId":54,"postTime":1313452484,"postText":">> you also start drama with crisis a lot\n\n\ni love you but that clearly showed you were not mature for an admin position \n/agree\n\nEdit: I forgot, the applications are open for JAIL.
