Because even when they are on, I get complaints from trusted regulars that not only do they fail to moderate properly, most the time the bring the server down with abuse, rdm, and just plain lack of competence."},{"postId":3216,"topicId":323,"posterId":13,"postTime":1277004811,"postText":"And even with as annoying as he may seem constantly asking, I believe that Ungrateful would make a good mod.
