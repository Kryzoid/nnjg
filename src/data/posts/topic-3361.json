I think it should be trimmed to a week ban, not a perm. Region has been with us for quite a while, and he's a respectable player. A perm for the first thing he has done, seems a little harsh. Look at the past *regulars* we banned, they had so many chances, then finally got perm'd. Like Sarver, he had SEVEN chances, and finally got perm'd. Vercon, he had a lot of chances, then finally got caught for his crap. \n\nsecond chances are good, I think a week ban would be good, not perm."},{"postId":26674,"topicId":3361,"posterId":79,"postTime":1311898257,"postText":"First offense or not, the ban fits the severity.
