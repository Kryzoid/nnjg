I get gagged by Udane for apparent singing, which I didn't do. He never stated that I should stop. He said the same thing to my buddy who followed me in (Windmill, by the way), and he gagged us both. He at least had the courtesy to ungag Windmill, but not me. Several rounds later, he perma-bans BOTH of us for trolling without prior warning. That moderator needs something taught to him about what a REAL troll of the internet is... I can point out a few on forgotten893's server if he's interested. His actions were uncalled for and childish. This occurred November the 3rd, 2011, at about 1:06 AM CST. My in-game name's the same as my name here, and my Steam ID's STEAM_0:1:25112710 ."},{"postId":37019,"topicId":4766,"posterId":605,"postTime":1320303008,"postText":"You both came in and started trolling, you trolled in the middle, and trolled till the end. Trolling is doing anything to invoke a negative reaction... this includes shorty after a player was informed to not mic spam, you piped in to sing as well. I gagged windmill for light trolling for that round. After constant trolling through text by the both of you, and considering you both came in trolling as a group, it's obvious you have no other intention but to do what you think would negativly affect another man.\nWhat really drives home this decision, your claim you didnt sing. A direct lie.\nDenied."}]}
