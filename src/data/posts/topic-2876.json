Every computer takes the project closer to our goals. Folding@home uses novel computational methods coupled to distributed computing, to simulate problems millions of times more challenging than previously achieved.\nSource:  http://folding.stanford.edu/English/Main  \nWhat is misfolding?\n>> Moreover, when proteins do not fold correctly (i.e. \"misfold\"), there can be serious consequences, including many well known diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Mad Cow (BSE), CJD, ALS, Huntington's, Parkinson's disease, and many Cancers and cancer-related syndromes.\nSource:  http://folding.stanford.edu/English/Main   \nWhat has been found by F@H already?\n>>  http://folding.stanford.edu/English/Papers  \nWant to help science?\nWindows 32/64-bit Smp client (Multi-core Processors)  http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/release/FAH6.34-win32-SMP.exe \nLinux 64-bit Smp Client (Multi-core Processors)  http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/release/FAH6.34-Linux64-SMP.exe \n Nvidia  GPU3 Client 32/64-bit  http://www.stanford.edu/~friedrim/Folding@home-Win32-GPU-systray-641.msi \n Ati  GPU2 Client 32/64-bit  http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/release/Folding@home-Win32-GPU-systray-623.msi \n\nNo Nerds Just Geeks: Team Number 207331 \n\n Prizes \n Top folder of the month: 75 TTT Points \n Second place folder of the month: 50 TTT Points \n Third place folder of the month: 25 TTT Points "},{"postId":23063,"topicId":2876,"posterId":237,"postTime":1306867642,"postText":"If i ever stop playing something, and can download this, i definitely will :)"},{"postId":23143,"topicId":2876,"posterId":237,"postTime":1306952443,"postText":"so i'm doing this...and it's taking FOREVER. like...22 hours, and it's 88% done. o.0"},{"postId":23175,"topicId":2876,"posterId":252,"postTime":1306995128,"postText":">> so i'm doing this...and it's taking FOREVER. like...22 hours, and it's 88% done. o.0 \nDoes take some time.

Oh well. It's a great idea to have one massive super computer (terminator anybody), for understanding on how a DNA folds."}]}
