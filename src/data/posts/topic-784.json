Today, riding the inevitable high that comes from coding for NNJG (totally not bragging or anything), I decided I should probably test myself and see what I remember about Python.  I have come to regret that desicion.  I start typing out a basic DOS-like program designed to take information from people and generate feedback, and do some basic math.  I did all of this successfully, except for, I shit you not, the \"print\" command. The very same print command that I used 6 times previously in the same program.  For whatever reason, Python looked at the 7th \"print\" command and promptly decided to fuck with my shit.  Anyone know what the hell is going on?  I'll post the full code if someone helps.  Thanks in advance."},{"postId":7745,"topicId":784,"posterId":113,"postTime":1284605733,"postText":"Nevermind guys, I got it.
