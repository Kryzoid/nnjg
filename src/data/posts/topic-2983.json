This does happen with the Mic but not as often due to the fact you can communicate this rather easily to the fellow guards but with typing you tend to try not to type as much due to the fact it costs too much time (this i'm basing on an average user) Fact of the matter is yeah wardens  who type are ok...but wardens with mics tend to be more efficient and more communicative due to the ease of communicating. \n\nSo personally I think the no mic no warden rule sounds alright"},{"postId":24696,"topicId":2983,"posterId":801,"postTime":1308857132,"postText":">> My main problem of people with a lack of Mic they tend to not bother appointing a warden or 3 or 4 people appoint themselves as warden, then half the time we get conflicting orders and end up being shot because of it.
