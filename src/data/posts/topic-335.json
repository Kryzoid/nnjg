I cant play the game anymore because I can't download any maps. The only thing I have done on my computer between 11 and 4 was open Source SDK but that shouldn't have done anything. I deleted all TTT related files and tried re-downloading them, didnt work, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Garrysmod 3 times, still didnt work, I unistalled steam and 60gb worth of games and reintsalled it, It still isnt working. I have a ton of lua errors every time I play TTT, but I can still play sandbox fine. The errors resemble something like Lua Error: \"zm_shotgun Not Found\" Im not really sure if thats it because im recalling it from my memory. Is it possible my TTT files got corrupt or deleted somehow overnight? Ive tried manually installing TTT but im not sure what version the server is using. Ill post screenshots whenever I can get back on to the server if someone thinks they know how to help me, maybe someone could send me all the maps and TTT gamemode the server uses and see how that works."},{"postId":3181,"topicId":335,"posterId":2,"postTime":1276927696,"postText":"A screenshot in-game would help."},{"postId":3185,"topicId":335,"posterId":82,"postTime":1276933272,"postText":"Haha, I went on a few minutes ago and everything works fine, It worked just as quickly as is stopped, I guess I went rambling on for nothing lol, at least I got 60 extra gigabytes out of it."},{"postId":3190,"topicId":335,"posterId":26,"postTime":1276946939,"postText":">> \nA few days ago TTT was working fine, I was on at around 11pm and the next day I went on everything was really messed up, all names of players were pink, I couldn't see any GUI, couldn't open player list, there was no animations and weapon models didn't load.
