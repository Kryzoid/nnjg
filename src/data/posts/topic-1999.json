Since im guessing theres more vips than there are admins/mods together.\n\n\nI just wanna know whose an admin / mod on TTT :D\nLike I didn't know about the admin named....

It will only alert the minges when the admins join the server. It's obvious who is ranked ingame. And funny, it does tell you what each color means.
