He called RDM on anything that he was killed for. One round he warned Treecko once to stop following him, then decided to kill him with one warning as evidence. Before Treecko was killed he called him out on his microphone, which then led me to KOS'ing him over mine. Before I was even able to shoot him though, he starts to shoot me and bring me down to 6 HP which is when we finally killed him. He was innocent. He said he started to kill me because I kos''ed him and \"he's not trying to get killed\". He also flamed many users really just complaining about how things didn't go his way.\nAdmins on?:Gash\nProof?:\n http://i52.tinypic.com/33wsdpi.jpg \n http://i56.tinypic.com/1zbxcv8.jpg \n http://i52.tinypic.com/15s3ps0.jpg \n http://i53.tinypic.com/2qlhok3.jpg \n http://i51.tinypic.com/a1pymf.jpg \n http://i53.tinypic.com/6ej4b6.jpg \n http://i53.tinypic.com/2uidldf.jpg \n http://i52.tinypic.com/2e52xs8.jpg "},{"postId":29673,"topicId":3659,"posterId":101,"postTime":1313558726,"postText":"Banned for a week and locked."}]}
