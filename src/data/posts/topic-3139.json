I have been banned from the server and want to know why. The reason given to me was mass RDMing but I did not mass RDM. I would like to know who has been accusing me of this and possibly clear up the issue.\n\nThanks in advance,\nSneekinbye"},{"postId":25013,"topicId":3139,"posterId":373,"postTime":1309331166,"postText":"To see who banned you try looking here: http://onlinecomphelp.com/bans/bans.php/\n\nInformation on Unban Requests here: http://www.nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1946\n\nIf you want to be unbanned please post an Unban Request in the correct format here: http://www.nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=14"},{"postId":25016,"topicId":3139,"posterId":316,"postTime":1309332053,"postText":"I vouge for him, ive played with him alot and hes never like acted like a troll or rdmed.
