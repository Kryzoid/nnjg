Ends 12:16 4/19\nWhat server were you playing?: TTT\nWho banned you?: Quack\nWhy should we unban you?:\nIm sorry for doing what i did, but i was just trying to protect myself. I did not know that it was against the rules to do that and i definitely did not think that it was bannable. This was the first thing that i ever did. I also think that my punishment was at most slayable or kickable, not bannable."},{"postId":18927,"topicId":2361,"posterId":84,"postTime":1302755433,"postText":"please post this in the correct area\n\nviewforum.php?f=14"},{"postId":18930,"topicId":2361,"posterId":54,"postTime":1302755782,"postText":"moved to the proper section, thanks for pointing that out Chopper.\nanyway, i'll wait for Quack to reply."},{"postId":18941,"topicId":2361,"posterId":112,"postTime":1302775187,"postText":"What do you mean you were trying to protect yourself?
