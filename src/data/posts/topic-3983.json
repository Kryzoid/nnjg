I think Aimbot felt overwhelmed by the amount of people making the remarks and he was the only Authoritative figure on. I spoke when I shouldn't have and I don't think it is an excuse that I mean it as a joke. I know that I should have been more respectful of Aimbot and in the future I plan to be more careful. Honestly, I do enjoy playing on this server and it's the only good gmod jailbreak server. I really enjoy the gmod jailbreak because it feels much more relaxed the CSS.

But that's a hypothetical, so naturally it's flawed. I was making fun of the fact he spelled it the wrong way. He spelled it ner - goes. I was hardly yelling racial slurs directly into someones face.
