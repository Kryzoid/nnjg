Those powers pull all nearby weapons, props, anything  not  welded to the floor.  After a preset time it would detonate, sending all the props/weapons scattered while some cautious player's thinking, \"What the fuck is that?!\" While a explosive barrel/large prop flattens him.  Or it could just cause damage to all players that get hit by the props, but it's still badass either way :3"},{"postId":16256,"topicId":1963,"posterId":272,"postTime":1298343124,"postText":"What if it just yanked everything into the center of the radius of the nade, and the props were sucked in, and did the damage?"},{"postId":16265,"topicId":1963,"posterId":373,"postTime":1298938325,"postText":">> What if it just yanked everything into the center of the radius of the nade, and the props were sucked in, and did the damage? \n\nBut the explosion of electro-magnetism is awesome..
