So if you can please consider me as an admin because I have been admin at least 2 or 3 times on a Team Fortress 2 server."},{"postId":12372,"topicId":1369,"posterId":385,"postTime":1293148855,"postText":"I think Katkong should be admin. I can back him up that he knows the server rules well. I noticed he does take everything seriously and does not let anything slide by. He's also a pretty nice person ^^. Anyway, I don't think it would be wrong to give him Admin at all."},{"postId":12373,"topicId":1369,"posterId":112,"postTime":1293149375,"postText":"We are currently accepting moderators for jail, if you want to apply for it just go here\n http://www.nonerdsjustgeeks.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=16 \n\nFollow the format and get the reccomendations."}]}
