If its used for fun its gaurenteed abuse, But whether people like it or not is the problem, Theres always that one douchebag who's trying to get everyone demoted just for having a laugh or two. thats why i just stick to doing stupid stuff ingame"},{"postId":9435,"topicId":960,"posterId":67,"postTime":1287506011,"postText":"solve the cash points problem by making vip a monthly or bi-monthly fee as opposed to a one time lousy one time donation?"},{"postId":9444,"topicId":960,"posterId":101,"postTime":1287516028,"postText":"Still Punked, if we did make all our current custom ones VIP only they wouldnt get as much stuff that they used to get which made em come back to the server :/"},{"postId":9446,"topicId":960,"posterId":6,"postTime":1287516238,"postText":">> Still Punked, if we did make all our current custom ones VIP only they wouldnt get as much stuff that they used to get which made em come back to the server :/ \nI have not posted once in this thread, WHY DOES EVERYONE BLAME ME!?
