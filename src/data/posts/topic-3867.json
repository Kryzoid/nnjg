Some nutjob has a \"vision\" from god, or some idiot does some \"research\". This whole thing is probably just to get people to his little \"camp\". The world most likely isn't ending anytime any of us are alive. September 26th will come and go like any other day, and nobody will remember this guy, or anything about it.

Half what a girl likes is your looks, then your personality, then your attitude, THEN after all the other bullshit they care about comes correct English (from experience). Plus, end of the world, who gives a fuck about correct grammar/spelling. Also, casual encounter section in Craigslist, all you need to do. ;)"},{"postId":31690,"topicId":3867,"posterId":988,"postTime":1314904175,"postText":"It's my birthday September 26th that's why the world will end."},{"postId":31692,"topicId":3867,"posterId":4,"postTime":1314908096,"postText":">> Birthday : September 19th, 7 days before that bologna.
