Just wait till it's over and then deal with it.\n\nToo many people see other people shooting and think \"HEY I MUST BE ABLE TO SHOOT THEM TOO\" and cause problems that shouldn't arise in the first place."},{"postId":35108,"topicId":4382,"posterId":1109,"postTime":1318132408,"postText":"hate it when some1 is called out by multiple people, but inno people dont pay attention and end up dieing\neven seen some were they try to claim the T rdm'd them\ndie a little bit inside when i see that happen :|"},{"postId":35225,"topicId":4382,"posterId":1097,"postTime":1318285719,"postText":">> hate it when some1 is called out by multiple people, but inno people dont pay attention and end up dieing\neven seen some were they try to claim the T rdm'd them\ndie a little bit inside when i see that happen :| \n\n#2.
