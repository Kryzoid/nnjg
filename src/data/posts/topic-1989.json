I have played on the TTT server and I love it! The people in NNJG are awesome, and I have played with most of the admins and other people I believe. Everything interests me, and I guess I'm a good conversationist. I am a Communist (for REAL Communism, not like Russia or China), but I do believe in Capitilsm too a little. I livve in the USA, oh, and I'm also an objectivist. (Thank you, Ayn Rand) and I forgot to mention I just got into reading recently (about a year ago). I'm pretty good to get along with but don't get on my bad side. I NEVER usually RDM, and I never have (so far :3). Anyways, please add me, I look forward to meeting the great people in NNJG! Also one question, may I wear the tag?"},{"postId":16387,"topicId":1989,"posterId":2,"postTime":1298592199,"postText":"Nice to meet you :D The tag is for anyone who wants to wear it, go right on ahead."}]}
