Nobody ever followed rules.\nOpinion based games were banned because some people had different opinions than others, and some guards would just say they didn't like the prisoners item/thing because they didn't like the player, and then freekill them. All the other guards and prisoners would be like, \"But that stuffs amazing\" and the guard wouldn't care.\nFreedays are banned because.... No idea."},{"postId":21007,"topicId":2617,"posterId":3,"postTime":1304714882,"postText":"I'm against the banning of Opinion games... and that bull run thingie.
