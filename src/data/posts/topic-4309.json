In the !motd it clearly says that Moderators have blue names.\n\nSecond of all, why would it matter WHO you're disrespecting? Disrespect against anyone is not allowed, not just ADMIN disrespect.\n\nThird, great lie. You were stuck in the teleporter and started shooting Spartan who was under you. While you were doing that, I was already teleporting other players that were stuck with you, as I had said. Treecko then killed you for attempting to kill Spartan, but had also accidentally killed Spartan as you were all stuck together.\n\nFourth, you can't contest bans shorter then a day, but I'm extending your ban seeing how blatantly you are lying to me."}]}
