You say that we don't need more admins or mods, but the fact is. We really do, just because admins say we dont doesn't make it true. The simple fact of the matter isn't that we can't post a ban request as much as it's annoying to us to play on a server for 5 hours and complain about a troll that most of the time they are left alone. Most trolls troll over voice chat rather then text. So getting proof is harder, second most trolls rdm on and off, so you cant prove that they are trolling (same with ghosters killing traitors).\n\nThe fact of the matter is from my count, we have 5-6 mods, 3-4 admins and 1 S. Admin. Divide that number by 2 and thats roughly how many will do something about the matter, divide that number again by 2 and we have the amount of mods-admins that will even reply/do something when a ban request is posted.

We lose our professional look to any new players on the server as well as some respect that most players might have. In my opinion regardless of who it is (long as they do something) we need another 3-4 mods and 1-2 admins. Less if you can find players that play non-stop or a good amount of time during the day. Either more mods and admins, or the mods and admins that are on look at the ban requests more often, reply quicker, and be a little more active.

Thats the ONLY proof we can give through screen shots of someone rdming, in that regard according to you, the only way they blatantly rdm is if its before 30 seconds into the round or if a mod/admin was on. Some of us can not take demos since it locks up our computers, so if you want more then damagelog proof, find a way to make it so people shooting shows up in logs. (cause from what i can tell, that is what the argument always comes down to, \"who really shot first\")\n\nThis is the problem with ban requests and why no one posts them. The proof that is requested by the admins isn't enough so why post a ban request in general. If you wanna argue about us needing to put ban requests up, then actually take them for what they are, proof of rdm or trolling. This thread is just gonna go back and forth between a few people who think we don't need more mods/admins and players that are sick of the mods/admins available not doing anything. Ban requests are fine if admins take them for what they are, more mods are fine because we might actually see less trolls/rdm on the server.\n\nBoth sides are not wrong or right. If more was done this thread wouldn't of been posted, at the same time if ban requests were responded to a little quicker and actually taken into account that they are legitimate then fine. Most ban requests may seem inefficient to some, but that is why we have things called day bans and week bans.

Some of us can not take demos since it locks up our computers, so if you want more then damagelog proof, find a way to make it so people shooting shows up in logs. (cause from what i can tell, that is what the argument always comes down to, \"who really shot first\")\n\nThis is the problem with ban requests and why no one posts them. The proof that is requested by the admins isn't enough so why post a ban request in general. If you wanna argue about us needing to put ban requests up, then actually take them for what they are, proof of rdm or trolling. This thread is just gonna go back and forth between a few people who think we don't need more mods/admins and players that are sick of the mods/admins available not doing anything. Ban requests are fine if admins take them for what they are, more mods are fine because we might actually see less trolls/rdm on the server.\n\nBoth sides are not wrong or right. If more was done this thread wouldn't of been posted, at the same time if ban requests were responded to a little quicker and actually taken into account that they are legitimate then fine. Most ban requests may seem inefficient to some, but that is why we have things called day bans and week bans. Not enough was proven to be a troll so no perma, but nothing says you can just let him off the hook since if that is done, everyone won't bother reporting people anymore, especially not someone they already reported. \nIf something is too insignificant to be proved by damage logs, you shouldn't even be posting a ban request for it. now, the entire damage log flooded with one guy rdming everyone, that yes."},{"postId":25470,"topicId":3165,"posterId":79,"postTime":1310170149,"postText":"The way i see it, 2 things happen pretty much when someone rdms. They either request a ban for some small portion of time, 1 day-2 days, or they get fed up and revenge rdm. No one will report the revenge because everyone understands why it was done. But then the troll/rdmer will post a ban request and the revenge rdm will get a week ban (not exactly fair). If possible even a vote slay added in would solve a good amount of issues, most people don't accept vote kick because \"why is he being kicked? ima vote no\". I believe that a vote slay people would directly think about as camping traitor or rdm.\n\nI believe that almost all the ban requests have some significant reasoning behind the post. But lot of people don't understand what rdm/troll is. To point out one of my ban requests, i had 8 pics of Pichu spamming me with points, about 3-4 mods/admins said, thats not trolling (the hell it isn't, spamming is ALWAYS trolling). Rdm is impossible to prove if your a T because, hey look, the damage logs show you doing damage at some point in time during the round, so it's not rdm at all.\n\nSome accounts of rdm are theoretically impossible to prove because everyone seems to think, \"eh, you prolly shot first\" or \"you killed someone earlier in the round\". This is another portion as to why ban requests don't work all the time. I truthfully believe that it would be best to get some 'more active'' mods/admins. \"We have enough mods/admins\" is a statement that might be true, if all those mods/admins were strictly for TTT, but the issue is that all the mods+ are spread out through other servers as well in which case we have very few active mods+ strictly playing TTT.\n\nI know no one other then mods+ think we have enough mods/admins, so maybe we could do a poll as to who thinks we have enough active mods/admins on TTT and maybe somehow find out some more players that mainly play TTT at different times to add to the mod/admin slots. All the mods and admins we have currently mainly play earlier in the day, which leaves night time to be a hectic war zone for trolls and rdms. So might I suggest we get a promotion to mod for someone who is on late nights most of the time.\n\nPersonally players i see late on at night:\n__Crisis\nSmooglez\nSohisohi\nUdane (before that stupid ass argument that won't be mentioned here)\n\nFew others that i cant remember. But overall those are the ones i see on at night. (I personally only play during the night cause I do stuff during the day)\n\nI know people in mod/admin positions won't agree to putting me as mod, but all I am doing is giving a list of those i see on at night time mainly. Another side note, most of the time when mods/admins are on during the night, they get tired of being told someone rdm/troll and end up leaving. I would like to see a bit more action with these mods/admins as to seeing them pass out judgement as well as sticking through the situation.

If people can't take being let down according to you, how do you think people feel when they OBVIOUSLY feel ignored or stuff isn't done.

From what i remember, you can make posts that only people of certain power can chat in but all can read. Played many different games and been a part of many forums, so you can make it public but public cant talk/post in it.\n\nSo all in all the points you both made are mute and not really good enough reason. Some stuff doesn't need to be public but other things need to be, like issues that are ''being dealt with'' that no one can tell are. The whole promotion thing, you might as well let anyone see because people will figure it out one way or another, and people will be angry/upset about who is promoted regardless if they know before hand, or after the fact.\n\nSo now, that being said, why not tell everyone whats being worked on so we don't bitch about these things being ignored anymore. Just letting us know whats going on will save a lot of annoyance from everyone spam messaging everyone on steam and thus allowing you to have more time to actually fix the problems then just talk about them to everyone spamming the forums or you in particular. \n\nOverall I believe that the points I've mentioned and made are valid whilst trying to be secretive for the reasons you announced have no viable reasons.

If you want someone to change the ONLY way is to let that person know what they need to change.

(personally i don't see how people would, maturity level wise they should be able to have a small let down like promotion) Also, i can guarantee 50% of the people are being fake about who they are because in human nature your either a suck up, or someone who doesn't care about someone higher then you. Me personally, i will argue with admins when i don't think they do their job. While others won't say a word to the admin but will tell the player to shut up when they themselves know someone else was at fault. If you want someone to be themselves at all times, go back to ''HIDING'' who is mod/admin. Telling people their is a mod on or admin on helps normal players, but helps trolls as well.
