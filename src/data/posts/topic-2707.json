You make it sound like your a mr big shot who has all his ideas be correct. You barely play on the TTT server so i dont see why you bash ideas. There random ideas that i've seen on other servers or ideas that would make certain guns a little better. The UMP is absolute trash and needs some type of upgrade. A FULL damn clip of the UMP isn't enough to kill someone with 100 health. That shows the weapon sux.
