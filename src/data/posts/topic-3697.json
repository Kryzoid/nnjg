Although i do agree that it is gunplanting, it wasn't my intention, i was just playing around.\nWhat server were you playing?: [NNJG] Jailbreak\nWho blacklisted you?:Maguroni\nWhy should we unblacklist you?:Because it honestly wan't my intention to gunplant. I am on the server almost every day and enjoy being a guard, so the fact that i was blacklisted for an accidental gunplant kind of killed the game for me. I do not have anything against maguroni. Im simply stating that i wasn't trying to inhibit gameplay at all, i was just trying to have fun."},{"postId":30003,"topicId":3697,"posterId":801,"postTime":1313817303,"postText":"i was in the match when he got blacklisted, and i didnt really notice it as a \"gun plant\" so i +support him getting unblacklisted. :)"},{"postId":30017,"topicId":3697,"posterId":916,"postTime":1313859472,"postText":"+Support I didn't Noticed a Gun plant Either When he Died He dropped the Gun Dont you always Drop Stuff When you die?"},{"postId":30165,"topicId":3697,"posterId":372,"postTime":1313900733,"postText":"I accept this request or whatever.
