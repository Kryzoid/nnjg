I know ur not looking for anyone else but with most of the current moderators/admins being on less and less i thought id see if i could apply. Im not really quick to judge but quick to blame, but i always listen to both sides before i do anything (normally rdm the one at fault if no admin/mod on currently). So thought id put my name out there and see where it goes.\n\nWould love to see some support if anyone would like me as a mod, not looking to be admin."},{"postId":3218,"topicId":339,"posterId":2,"postTime":1277009265,"postText":">> I know ur not looking for anyone else\n \nWrong section, and we aren't accepting any more moderators or admins unless hand-picked."}]}
