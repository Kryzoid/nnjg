I even told Crisis why I killed the victim the next round, requested to get slayed and the victim also accepted my apology afterwards. The ban request was for me 'rdming'' when I didn't rdm. I was shooting at Crisis for killing someone and hit someone else. I told Crisis this in the next round, and requested to get slayed for it. But Crisis claimed I rdmed and was not yet punished.\n\nI believe Crisis has a grudge on me for getting him perma'd and this behaviour is just childish.\n\nAnd yes, there is no proof but I will not let this go unheard. And yes, the ban was short but it doesn't matter because the request was completely fabricated and against rules.\n>> -Do not lie in a ban request.\n -DO NOT POST FAKED PROOF. If you are caught attempting to get somebody banned with fake proof you will be permanently banned from all of our servers with no chance of redemption.
