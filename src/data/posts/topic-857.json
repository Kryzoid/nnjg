Like you can plant them, they get like a really loud beeping so people around can hear that someone planted a mine, and a blue ring (kind of like if you get beaconed in TF2) appears once. Then, if someone walks within a certain (VERY SMALL) radius it displays another beep (maybe the sped up C4 beep when it's like 2 seconds from exploding) and if they continue to walk over it it blows up. Instant death to the person who triggered it (unless it was near a ledge and they manage to jump down in time, but what traitor is that dumb?[you are so dumb, you are really dumb, fo realz]) and anyone in the radius at which it would do the fast C4 beep.
