So I was looking for a certain emblem and looked all over for it and finally found one place that had it, but on a pic with a few others, and it's a gif on top of that. I am completely suck at this, I had to have someone make spray or me ^^. First I want to ask if there is anyone that can cut them all out and preferably make it into normal format, I will love you long time as is customary for anyone that does anything for me. If not can someone give me basic instructions on what to do.\n\nThanks in advance~"},{"postId":7164,"topicId":783,"posterId":4,"postTime":1284000627,"postText":"my break is over. i'll gladly do it :D"},{"postId":7165,"topicId":783,"posterId":13,"postTime":1284003309,"postText":"Ohhhh thank you Kry ^^, I need to find a way to pay you back somehow for all the projects you for me.
