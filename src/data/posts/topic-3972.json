Corey W. Rogerson\nYour Steam ID:STEAM_0:0:24225449 \nReason: Exploiting map de_vegas\nLength of Ban/Date and Time of Unban: 3d ending in three days.\nWhat server were you playing?:TTT\nWho banned you?:Gash\nWhy should we unban you?:\n\nWell i feel that three days is a bit much for the kind of exploiting we were doing, we were just trying to get on this building. then another player shot near me and my first reaction was to shoot him. i killed him and then me and Ryancarson25 roamed around exploring and looking for places to bury him. we said repeatedly tell me if im last inno, ill slay myself. gash then waited for a while to ban us, like 15 minutes. he never warned us, for we'd have stopped. i'm sorry and i didnt realize that i was ruining the game."},{"postId":32038,"topicId":3972,"posterId":605,"postTime":1315121539,"postText":"This went on for 4 rounds of you guys hiding outside the map, despite many players request for you to stop.
