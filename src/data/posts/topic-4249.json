From Half-life 2, more counterstrike models, etc.  Sure it would make individuals easy to identify, which could be a downside, but if you're vain enough (I am) to want a unique character, deal with it.  The only real problem other that is that the advanced disguiser wouldn't show you wearing these if you disguised as a person with that, but it doesn't anyway so eh.  I would love more stuff, but it all comes down to the people with the time and know-how to add them."},{"postId":33869,"topicId":4249,"posterId":612,"postTime":1316548364,"postText":"I think if you are a good traitor , it doesnt matter what you have from the shop. i have a custom trial and get called out alot and still have successful traitor rounds.\ni support player models"},{"postId":33874,"topicId":4249,"posterId":1094,"postTime":1316549153,"postText":"Well yeah, I support them too.
