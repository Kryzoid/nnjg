So yeah, I just wanted to give you a heads up for MY inactivity in the near future. \n\nAlso, I guess I'll change the name of this to everyones doings of this summer, since I don't want it to be about just me."},{"postId":24188,"topicId":3038,"posterId":48,"postTime":1308256479,"postText":"Probably active.\n\nI need to find a job this summer, so I may be on less... but still active more than likely."},{"postId":24189,"topicId":3038,"posterId":101,"postTime":1308256790,"postText":"Not applicable."},{"postId":24191,"topicId":3038,"posterId":272,"postTime":1308257031,"postText":"active as shit"},{"postId":24208,"topicId":3038,"posterId":142,"postTime":1308261266,"postText":"I'll try to be active tho I probably won't as much, working on college app and money aid, along with finding a job."},{"postId":24209,"topicId":3038,"posterId":4,"postTime":1308261345,"postText":">> my parents act as if I'm asian and expect me to get straight A's and B's.
