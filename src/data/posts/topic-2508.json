If you haven't read the rules recently I advise you to look at them again. Shitposting and Blankquoting are against the rules. The rules are in place to keep the forums clean and friendly. If you continue to shitpost or spam in threads your posts are going to end up being deleted, or making the thread get locked.\n\nIf you really can't contain yourself we do have a whole forum for you, the spam box. Check it out sometime.\n\nI guess this isn't a bad time to remind you that you aren't supposed to comment in a ban/unban request unless you're an admin, mod, or directly involved.
