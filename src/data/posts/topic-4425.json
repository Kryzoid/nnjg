I saw a detective shoot arguyle in the head and kill him, so I shot the detective once, before I realized he was a detective. I quickly apologized, just to have bourne shoot me. I killed him, lost 2 points and I said HE SHOT ME FIRST. i got then shot to death and it all seemed like I just RDMed. I am sorry, but people just cause too many problems.\n\nPeople like Combustible lemons, just RDM me when no admins are on, and get away with it. They RDM with stupid reasons such as \"you have low health\". Don't even care about the 2 points they lose. Udane, I know this is my 2nd accidental RDM, but I think you need to be less sympathetic to the people that start the whole thing itself. Arguyle was shot to death by what looked like the detective, who waltzed past the un IDed body. Arguyle was innocent, so I shot the detective, before I found out he was a detective. When my crosshairs landed on him, I was about to stop. Bourne then shot me which led to his death and eventually mine. I'm sorry, This was not on purpose and would've been avoided in the first place if the detective hadn't killed Arguyle."},{"postId":35046,"topicId":4425,"posterId":812,"postTime":1318036172,"postText":"Udane dealt with this over steam, locked."}]}
