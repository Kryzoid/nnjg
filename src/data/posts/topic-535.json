Demon because he kept starting to pick fights with me, completely unneccesary fights, while trying to do my job and muting/gaging people that were trolling or just generally starting fights over everything. And I don't gag/ungag my fellow traitors ever. I've gagged/ungagged people who have killed me, once or twice as a joke. And this is mostly when there are few people on the server. I think I've only done it once when there were a lot of people on, significantly affecting the game or ruining the match for the traitors. Besides, no one seems to listen when I do it anyway, so it's pretty much like saying YOU DOUCHE from beyond the grave.\n\nDon't try to exagerrate the facts Josh and Koiwai."},{"postId":4947,"topicId":535,"posterId":4,"postTime":1280772833,"postText":"Well, i'm not gonna lie but i have seen him encourage a mass rdm fest on lost temple recently."},{"postId":4949,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1280777042,"postText":">> \nWell, i'm not gonna lie but i have seen him encourage a mass rdm fest on lost temple recently.\n \n\nI did no such thing"},{"postId":4950,"topicId":535,"posterId":4,"postTime":1280779263,"postText":">> \n>> \nWell, i'm not gonna lie but i have seen him encourage a mass rdm fest on lost temple recently.\n \n\nI did no such thing\n \n\nForcing innocents to go into the traitor room entrance so that they can die, pushing them back in so they cant escape, and laughing when someone presses the button which makes them die is probably not a good thing to do as a VIP, let alone say \"I did no such thing\""},{"postId":4956,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1280791035,"postText":">> \n>> \n>> \nWell, i'm not gonna lie but i have seen him encourage a mass rdm fest on lost temple recently.\n \n\nI did no such thing\n \n\nForcing innocents to go into the traitor room entrance so that they can die, pushing them back in so they cant escape, and laughing when someone presses the button which makes them die is probably not a good thing to do as a VIP, let alone say \"I did no such thing\"\n \n\nAgain, I didn't do any of those things, well save laughing when someone pushed someone in the traitor room."},{"postId":4957,"topicId":535,"posterId":153,"postTime":1280791806,"postText":"How can he make you do that?"},{"postId":4958,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1280797269,"postText":">> Ben\":22mrsbau]\nHow can he make you do that?\n \n\n*Shrugs shoulders*\nI know one user that managed to do it by shoving barrels in and saying that you couldn't get killed by the trap anymore.\nWas pretty funny actually."},{"postId":4995,"topicId":535,"posterId":106,"postTime":1280873390,"postText":"Yea ungreaful dead Rdmed me a few times when I was on"},{"postId":4998,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1280876202,"postText":">> \nYea ungreaful dead Rdmed me a few times when I was on\n \n\n?\nI've never even seen you online before."},{"postId":5001,"topicId":535,"posterId":106,"postTime":1280877666,"postText":"Sure Ungreatful"},{"postId":5003,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1280878256,"postText":">> \nSure Ungreatful\n \n\nNo seriously, who the hell are you."},{"postId":5004,"topicId":535,"posterId":106,"postTime":1280878500,"postText":"Sure Pretend not to know me"},{"postId":5063,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1281029814,"postText":">> \nSure Pretend not to know me\n \n\nI really haven't the slightest clue who you are.\nWork with me here, when are you usually on, like 1-4, 10-1, what?"},{"postId":5083,"topicId":535,"posterId":107,"postTime":1281041613,"postText":"Also, he always harrases younger members constantly, and is very rude"},{"postId":5085,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1281044280,"postText":">> \nAlso, he always harrases younger members constantly, and is very rude\n \n\nNo, just demon and link."},{"postId":5098,"topicId":535,"posterId":107,"postTime":1281054512,"postText":"I'll quote with what I sent to Ben:\n\n\n>> Hey, this isn't like a ban request or anything, I just don't think it's a good idea to have Ungrateful as a VIP.  He is incredibally rude, even to people new to the server.  He just harrasses players with higher pitched voices without voice changers, and spews swearing and such.  I don't really think VIPs/Mods/Admins should be super strict or serious, it's just I don't think you want someone that rude to represent the people with power on your servers.  It's your choice and all, it's just I wouldn't choose him to have any power on my server\n "},{"postId":5117,"topicId":535,"posterId":39,"postTime":1281124798,"postText":">> \nI'll quote with what I sent to Ben:\n\n\n>> Hey, this isn't like a ban request or anything, I just don't think it's a good idea to have Ungrateful as a VIP.  He is incredibally rude, even to people new to the server.  He just harrasses players with higher pitched voices without voice changers, and spews swearing and such.  I don't really think VIPs/Mods/Admins should be super strict or serious, it's just I don't think you want someone that rude to represent the people with power on your servers.  It's your choice and all, it's just I wouldn't choose him to have any power on my server\n \n\n \n\nDrop it Koiwai.
