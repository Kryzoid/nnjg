Basically, it's trickery, but harder... and well, I lied about the longer. I decided it was too hard to make too long, more so with remembering 4 numbers that could be between the numbers of 1-8.\nGood news is, this map includes its own large bathtub filled slightly with slime. It is located right behind you in the spawn room, in a room on the side. Why? I'm not sure.\nWhat else does this map include you may ask? I'll never tell you how many times your gonna have to hold that shift button while jumping at the last second, never.\nP.S. Those not too good at puzzle/new players... please dont hate me ;~; they made me do it, I swear!\n\n*Edit: Went from b2 to b3, as there was a slight chance of a bug that would ruin part of a \"puzzle\" untill someone got close to said spot and died."}]}
