It has nothing on mine. My mom practically kicked my ass \nout of the house before I hit thirteen, and I never even met my dad. My only \nfriend till I was ten was the kool-aid freak next store who was always beating \nthe sh*t out of me and telling me I wasn’t worth sh*t. Its not even like I had \na choice. During my entire adolescence, I was moving around from place to \nplace trying to get along with people who didn’t even want me.\n\nYou think that’s the worst? My only friend was an Asian guy in his thirties or \nsomething, who only kept me around because he thought I could help him get \nlaid. The only perk was that I also got to hang around with this cute ginger \nchick. She was flat as a pancake, sure, but damn, she was a total nymph. \nShe must have been a sadist or something cause she always took pleasure in \nhitting me and telling me how she loved to get wet.\n\nBut dear god, the bane of my existence was this adult couple that I could NOT \nseem to avoid. You know, those absolutely sickening couples, like they wear \nmatching outfits and finish each other’s sentences? Yeah they were total \ncreepers. They also had a cat, which was at least twice as annoying as they \nwere. I swear, this thing would never shut the feck up.\n\nLike I said, I ended up moving from town to town getting into fights with \nother kids my age, even adults from time to time.\n\n\nThe only thing that kept me going was my dream to become a Pokemon \nmaster."},{"postId":21572,"topicId":2686,"posterId":115,"postTime":1305143036,"postText":"Uhh, what."},{"postId":21573,"topicId":2686,"posterId":373,"postTime":1305143366,"postText":"Troll comment?
