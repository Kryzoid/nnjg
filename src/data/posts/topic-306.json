Now, I am no coder and I have no experience in coding at all so I don;t know if it is difficult to add new tools to the server but Here is a link to Smart Weld. http://www.garrysmod.org/downloads/?a=view&id=18508 \n\nBasically what this tool does is do a shit ton of welds for you by only left clicking each piece u need welded once....not 90000000 times. So say if u make an 8 prop boat, instead of clicking your props 72 times, you click on ur props 8 times, then do a nice right click and baddah bing baddah boom, your done. Again, this idea will probably fall through, but just throwing it out there. \n\nThanks  ;D"},{"postId":2960,"topicId":306,"posterId":48,"postTime":1276658538,"postText":"I think Bird said he was actually gonna add this\n\n:D"},{"postId":2986,"topicId":306,"posterId":67,"postTime":1276662475,"postText":"would the undo button release all of the welds created by the smart weld or no?"},{"postId":2987,"topicId":306,"posterId":58,"postTime":1276662911,"postText":"NO entirely sure nixon, but I think that would be the most logical assumption"},{"postId":3017,"topicId":306,"posterId":3,"postTime":1276730651,"postText":"I have added this. and yea, it does undo everything"}]}
