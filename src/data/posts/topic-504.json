I told him I would investigate this if I was provided with evidence, he continued to mic spam over a period of 10 minutes on an unrelated matter and had already threatened to get the whole of your group to troll us constantly and \"destroy\" our server. I muted him. He then raged and tried to mass rdm, saying in chat whilst dead, \"You mute me, I troll you\". So he was banned.\n\nI then joined your server under a fake name and listened to him on mic telling everyone to join my server and troll. I took the STEAM ID, of everyone on and then got one of my admins to ban them via sourcebans, as one of your players claims to be banned he must of been on and heard it, doing nothing to stop it. He then continued and the whole server was laughing about how they were going to bring us down etc.\n\nHowever only two members got through before the bans and were banned by in game admins, check the time between their ban and striders ban.\n\nhttp://pezbans.ukgamers.com/ban/index.php?p=banlist&page=2 Look at the two, above striders ban, their names and time of ban.\n\n2) Why have your members attack our server?\n\nI have not asked any member to attack your server. Usually I discipline those that do such a thing to other servers yet given the circumstances I can see why they did it and thus only talked to them. Unfortunately we have over 50 members on Gmod so that can take some time.\n\n3) Why do you have to attempt to change our reputation? We have loyal members, and your admins just joined the server, took SteamID's, and banned them with SourceBans on your servers. \n\nI have not attempted to change your reputation, that thread was not attacking you or claiming that you were a fail group in any way. It was stating that this is what over modification causes. I would of posted this at any time, but I only visited your server for the first time that day.\n\nThey are banned as explained earlier, they do not play on the server so why does it matter anyway? If they would like an unban they can ask.\n\nLastly, why would I start a \"clan war\" the pez server is the 2nd main TT server just behind ECG. What do i gain from it? nothing. What do your members get from trolling my community, decreased server activity, which is why they \"tried\" to do it.\n\nWhat I suggest is you ban Strider permanently for causing all this trouble, I can provide chat logs if asked too.\n\nMade this public."},{"postId":4618,"topicId":504,"posterId":117,"postTime":1280054043,"postText":"http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AGAINSTPEZGAMING\n\nMade by Strider.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Little-mo"},{"postId":4619,"topicId":504,"posterId":153,"postTime":1280062043,"postText":">> \n1) What started the whole thing against NNJG with Pez?\n\nA player called \"Strider\" \"STEAM_0:0:500012\" joined our server and started complaining about 2 of our members Nicole and Pie trolling your server last night by running up to each other and killing themselves, not from RDMing and breaking no rules.
