They sound great, so far.\n\nOnce CC is complete, we're going to hold a going-away party.\nThere will be cake, giveaways, optional PvP, and moments of total, unrestricted anarchy.\n Stop by, even if you're planning on leaving us afterward. It'll be fun to watch, trust me. \n\nAfter that, we'll distribute our map, for people who'd like to continue in Singleplayer.\nYou can finally raid other people's houses, play with fire, and blow shit up.\n\nAfter the party's finished, we'll undergo a brief downtime, likely less than a day.\nThe new server will go up, hopefully recognizing us as goldcraft.org by then.\n\nCC will be enormous, and there will be a massive hotel for people who can't get a house together.\nThere'll be free p2p warping for the first couple of days, along with contests based upon architecture, treasure hunts, and (maaaybe) bounties.\n\nIf you're leaving because of the reset, we're sorry things didn't turn out like you wanted.\nStop by sometime, we'd love to have you back.\n\nWe hope you like the new Goldcraft."}]}
