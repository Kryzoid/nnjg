He shut that down and then made nnjg. I have been playing on nnjg on and off, but I was never really involved. Today I was wondering why I never stayed with him when he changed to NNJG, I think part of it is the change... When he changed the server and removed my admin I was pretty pissed off. But I now realize it was for the better and that holding an old grudge is rather pointless. \n\nAnyways, Im glad to be here and wish I would have come to my scenes way sooner.\n\n\nThanks,\n-The odd one"},{"postId":7419,"topicId":795,"posterId":48,"postTime":1284223117,"postText":">> Hey guys!\n\nMy name is The Odd One.\n\nI used to be an admin on Shadow's (AKA Mr. Gash's) OLD OLD dark rp server.
