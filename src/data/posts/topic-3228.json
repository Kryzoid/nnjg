I think they should all be grey.\nThere's a lot of guards that don't freekill but are stupid enough to kill a disquised prisoner just because they\nknow that they are one."},{"postId":25676,"topicId":3228,"posterId":112,"postTime":1310732324,"postText":"There's no way to make it impossible for guards to know who the prisoners were.\nThey could just look at the scoreboard and find your name under the prisoner tab. The colors make it easier for everybody to figure out whats going on.\n\nYou just have to post ban requests for the rdmers/ hope somebody else does."},{"postId":25685,"topicId":3228,"posterId":372,"postTime":1310754254,"postText":"What I don't get is why when prisoners disguise, they don't have their name change color to blue.  This would remove most of the obviousness that the person was disguised, and result in less free kills."}]}
