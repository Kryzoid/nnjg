Currently its single player only but they have a demo of the game.\n\nIts a zombie game based 100% on survival, try to live as long as you can while escaping the terrible zombie infection. The games graphics are a little better then minecrafts and expected to be a lot added to the game. Currently there are around 4-5 weapons, a small crafting system, barricade system and a few rednecks trying to take over your house and kill you/your wife. You have a wife thats horribly injured (broken leg) and the mission is to either take care of her while you live through this infection or kill her (smother her with the pillow was my choice). I would suggest people take a look see what they think and maybe try out the demo.\n\nMy best was living for 39 days 12 hours. This game is not easy and you will die from going insane. (drink some whiskey and anti-depressents to help ya calm down)"},{"postId":25456,"topicId":3204,"posterId":693,"postTime":1310153584,"postText":"I didn't care much for it. Don't really know why."}]}
